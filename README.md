# No Pants Island

So, social networks are awesome.  They help us stay in touch with pretty much everybody we've ever met.  I have friends on Facebook I met exactly once in Heidelberg in Germany.  I still see their updates when I dip my toes into social media.  But that space is getting polluted.  Sure, by advertisements and trigger-finger aunts that retweet everything they see.  There's my Facebook friends, and then there's my actual friends.  The handful of people my girlfriend and I have in our lives.  There's my sister in London, a friend in San Francisco, and couple friends in Philadelphia that I'm really tight with.  These are the people I wanna keep close, and have in my life a lot.  They're the people you feel like yourself around.

Also, there is *the internet*, which is awesome, and open, and free.  Whenever I want to, in a little over 1/10th of a second, I can send 64 1's and 0's to my sister's house in London *and back*.  Pretty much for free.  We can't share space, but we can share time.  Wouldn't it be awesome if we could all sort of be in the same place at once?

## Share a space

The NPI Device is basically like a piece of shared furniture.  When I come home, I flick the switch and a blink let's everybody know I'm in the room.  In England, 1/10th of a second later, a little light blinks and my sister knows that I'm in the room now.  If she wants to say hi, she can press this little button, and a light in Cambridge, MA will blink.  It's direct, and it's tactile, and it's immediate.  It's simple.

## Send a letter

Oh, and it has a receipt printer for messages you might want to send.  These aren't saved anywhere.  Once your friend receives it and it's printed out, that's it.  It's like a letter or a mixtape.  It's physical.  It's casual, immediate contact with people you wish were closer.

## Why do you hate posterity so much?

We don't.  But aren't old letters awesome?  You have a physical thing that's the only one of its kind.  You can keep it in a cigar box somewhere, and next time you move, you'll have it and it'll be a special collection of atoms for you.  If you want to save a message, save it!

## Do you hate social media?

Nope, it's awesome.  We use it every day.  But we wanna try and use the internet for a different kind of private communication.  It's there and it's free, and I want to be able to hit a button in Boston and turn a light on in San Francisco.
