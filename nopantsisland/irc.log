[2012-01-25 08:03:58 UTC] <george> 2. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
[2012-01-25 08:03:58 UTC] <george> 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

[2012-01-26 23:47:15 UTC] <aeonflux> because your writing is AWESOME?
[2012-01-26 23:47:26 UTC] <fantasmo> she always liked it :)
[2012-01-26 23:47:39 UTC] <fantasmo> you know
[2012-01-26 23:47:43 UTC] <fantasmo> i have a nanowrimo novel
[2012-01-26 23:47:47 UTC] <aeonflux> HA
[2012-01-26 23:47:47 UTC] <fantasmo> unfinished
[2012-01-26 23:47:49 UTC] <aeonflux> christ
[2012-01-26 23:47:51 UTC] <aeonflux> of course you do
[2012-01-26 23:47:57 UTC] <fantasmo> probably like, 1/5th of a novel
[2012-01-26 23:47:58 UTC] <aeonflux> oh RIGHT, you told me about this!
[2012-01-26 23:48:03 UTC] <fantasmo> i went back and looked at it not too long ago
[2012-01-26 23:48:13 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah?
[2012-01-26 23:48:18 UTC] <fantasmo> it's funny like
[2012-01-26 23:48:28 UTC] <fantasmo> ok, so do you ever look at something you made years later
[2012-01-26 23:48:34 UTC] <fantasmo> and it almost feels like someone else made it?
[2012-01-26 23:48:49 UTC] <aeonflux> oh definitely
[2012-01-26 23:48:53 UTC] <aeonflux> i actually kindof love that feeling
[2012-01-26 23:48:55 UTC] <fantasmo> yeah
[2012-01-26 23:48:57 UTC] <fantasmo> it's really ince, like
[2012-01-26 23:49:00 UTC] <aeonflux> because you have some level of objectivity
[2012-01-26 23:49:03 UTC] <fantasmo> i feel like i can like it more
[2012-01-26 23:49:06 UTC] <fantasmo> because i'm removed from it
[2012-01-26 23:49:25 UTC] <aeonflux> when did you start it again?
[2012-01-26 23:49:31 UTC] <fantasmo> oh jesus, i dunno
[2012-01-26 23:49:32 UTC] <fantasmo> '08?
[2012-01-26 23:49:40 UTC] <fantasmo> let's see what the last modified date is
[2012-01-26 23:49:58 UTC] <aeonflux> haha
[2012-01-26 23:50:01 UTC] <aeonflux> what did you write in?
[2012-01-26 23:50:25 UTC] <fantasmo> some darkroom clone
[2012-01-26 23:50:29 UTC] <fantasmo> oh man
[2012-01-26 23:50:51 UTC] <fantasmo> i wrote this when i was going out with that batshit crazy bipolar aerialist for like 3 weeks!  i remember working on it on a megabus to new york 
[2012-01-26 23:50:56 UTC] <aeonflux> HAHAHAHAH
[2012-01-26 23:51:01 UTC] <aeonflux> of course!
[2012-01-26 23:51:05 UTC] <fantasmo> man good riddence
[2012-01-26 23:51:06 UTC] <aeonflux> fucking aerialists man
[2012-01-26 23:51:08 UTC] <fantasmo> what a nutjob
[2012-01-26 23:51:12 UTC] <aeonflux> lol
[2012-01-26 23:51:19 UTC] <aeonflux> well, yeah
[2012-01-26 23:51:23 UTC] <aeonflux> if she was bipolar
[2012-01-26 23:51:25 UTC] <aeonflux> that'll do it
[2012-01-26 23:51:26 UTC] <fantasmo> so i guess 2010
[2012-01-26 23:51:29 UTC] <fantasmo> or less
[2012-01-26 23:51:44 UTC] <aeonflux> it's a pretty fun mental illness at first but then it gets WEIRD
[2012-01-26 23:52:11 UTC] <aeonflux> man, do you ever think about like, the weight of all the everything you've created in your life?
[2012-01-26 23:52:25 UTC] <fantasmo> explain more
[2012-01-26 23:52:28 UTC] <fantasmo> ENHANCE
[2012-01-26 23:52:38 UTC] <aeonflux> like everything, all creative output you've ever written or said or typed or drew or made
[2012-01-26 23:52:47 UTC] <aeonflux> it's GIGANTIC
[2012-01-26 23:52:49 UTC] <aeonflux> ha man
[2012-01-26 23:53:00 UTC] <aeonflux> i used to do that as an exercise when i'd feel real down on myself a few years back
[2012-01-26 23:53:17 UTC] <aeonflux> i think i'm way more of a jerk now, ha
[2012-01-26 23:53:36 UTC] <fantasmo> ha
[2012-01-26 23:53:40 UTC] <fantasmo> man, wel
[2012-01-26 23:53:50 UTC] <fantasmo> yeah i guess so, i don't think of it as weight exactly
[2012-01-26 23:53:51 UTC] <aeonflux> much more physically large abstraction of everything i've done
[2012-01-26 23:53:57 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah well, it's funny
[2012-01-26 23:54:11 UTC] <aeonflux> i always ascribe sortof a physicality to everything i do, even if it's a code project or something
[2012-01-26 23:54:32 UTC] <aeonflux> i think it comes from thinking of how much time it took in my life and how into it i was
[2012-01-26 23:54:46 UTC] <aeonflux> but it always gets visualized as a huge book
[2012-01-26 23:54:50 UTC] <fantasmo> woah
[2012-01-26 23:54:51 UTC] <aeonflux> HEALTH COOKIE OVER
[2012-01-26 23:54:52 UTC] <aeonflux> sigh

[2012-01-27 00:02:54 UTC] <clarence> 2. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
[2012-01-27 00:02:54 UTC] <clarence> 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

[2012-01-27 00:20:25 UTC] <fantasmo> so that's it with everything pulled out
[2012-01-27 00:20:35 UTC] <fantasmo> in that top right round part is where the crankshaft goes
[2012-01-27 00:20:45 UTC] <fantasmo> which is what the piston connects to
[2012-01-27 00:21:01 UTC] <fantasmo> and those two long bolts shooting off it are what you bolt the cylinder onto
[2012-01-27 00:21:14 UTC] <fantasmo> oh! http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrquint15/3434562012/in/set-72157594309117064/

[2012-01-27 00:22:58 UTC] <fantasmo> wow
[2012-01-27 00:23:06 UTC] <fantasmo> my science projects set looks awesome as a big thing of thumbnails
[2012-01-27 00:25:17 UTC] <fantasmo> did you ever read zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance?
[2012-01-27 00:26:21 UTC] <aeonflux> oh that's crazy!
[2012-01-27 00:26:24 UTC] <aeonflux> NAKED ENGINE!

[2012-01-27 00:26:33 UTC] <aeonflux> love that book
[2012-01-27 00:26:49 UTC] <aeonflux> i was actually thinkin about that as a reread sometime soon
[2012-01-27 00:26:55 UTC] <aeonflux> only read it once but it deserves another look
[2012-01-27 00:27:16 UTC] <fantasmo> same
[2012-01-27 00:27:24 UTC] <fantasmo> i remember it feeling like a real up-hill read
[2012-01-27 00:27:35 UTC] <fantasmo> once he starts trying to define 'quality'
[2012-01-27 00:27:44 UTC] <fantasmo> but the beginning has some awesome like, simple engine philosophy
[2012-01-27 00:27:51 UTC] <fantasmo> about getting your head into a system when you're working on ti
[2012-01-27 00:29:26 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah - man, i should really reread
[2012-01-27 00:29:32 UTC] <aeonflux> i'm in a very different headspace than when i read it
[2012-01-27 00:29:40 UTC] <aeonflux> i was like, the most bummed ashley ever when i read it
[2012-01-27 00:29:45 UTC] <aeonflux> and it really resonated
[2012-01-27 00:30:10 UTC] <aeonflux> but i think it'd be good to reread it now that i'm back to nominal
[2012-01-27 00:30:15 UTC] <fantasmo> yeah
[2012-01-27 00:30:21 UTC] <aeonflux> my first year in boston was like, really really bad

[2012-01-27 00:30:27 UTC] <fantasmo> in boston 
[2012-01-27 00:30:34 UTC] <fantasmo> mostly in algiers probably

[2012-02-02 01:14:45 UTC] <charlie> right up my alley
[2012-02-02 01:15:05 UTC] <charlie> also, i first heard about it on Archer
[2012-02-02 01:15:17 UTC] <charlie> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga
[2012-02-02 01:15:23 UTC] <charlie> though i'm sure you're already there
[2012-02-02 01:15:39 UTC] <aeonflux> have you been here? http://www.yelp.com/biz/daiso-japan-san-francisco-2
[2012-02-02 01:15:48 UTC] <aeonflux> i was just looking for smoke shops where they might have butane lighters
[2012-02-02 01:15:51 UTC] <aeonflux> and that showed up on yelp
[2012-02-02 01:15:54 UTC] <aeonflux> and immediatley derailed me
[2012-02-02 01:15:58 UTC] <aeonflux> HAHAHA
[2012-02-02 01:16:06 UTC] <aeonflux> you should definitely learn a martial art you learned about on Archer
[2012-02-02 01:16:08 UTC] <aeonflux> DEFINITELY
[2012-02-02 01:16:21 UTC] <aeonflux> they probably have like, 3 grand master level teachers within a 10 block radius of your house
[2012-02-02 01:16:23 UTC] <charlie> i have not been here
[2012-02-02 01:16:25 UTC] <aeonflux> since this is San Francisco
[2012-02-02 01:16:27 UTC] <charlie> they do!
[2012-02-02 01:16:29 UTC] <aeonflux> it looks pretty cute
[2012-02-02 01:16:29 UTC] <charlie> there's a school here
[2012-02-02 01:16:42 UTC] <charlie> http://www.kravmaga-sf.com/krav/home.php

[2012-02-02 01:17:34 UTC] <aeonflux> this looks pretty awesome
[2012-02-02 01:17:41 UTC] <charlie> general principles include:
[2012-02-02 01:17:44 UTC] <aeonflux> i will say like, i have never had a workout as awesome as karate was
[2012-02-02 01:17:46 UTC] <charlie> Counter attacking as soon as possible (or attacking preemptively).
[2012-02-02 01:17:50 UTC] <aeonflux> hahaha
[2012-02-02 01:17:52 UTC] <charlie> Targeting attacks to the body's most vulnerable points such as the eyes, jaw, throat, groin, knee, etc.
[2012-02-02 01:17:58 UTC] <charlie> Neutralizing the opponent as quickly as possible by responding with an unbroken stream of counter attacks and if necessary a take down/joint break.
[2012-02-02 01:18:06 UTC] <aeonflux> HAHAHA
[2012-02-02 01:18:12 UTC] <charlie> Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat in order to look for escape routes, further attackers, objects that could be used to defend or help attack and so on.
[2012-02-02 01:18:28 UTC] <charlie> it's just great basically. no pomp.  all circumstance

[2012-02-02 19:54:15 UTC] <charlie> when i stubbed out these api models
[2012-02-02 19:54:44 UTC] <charlie> i had them say "I await further instructions on accessing this api." while i tested without actually implementing the methods to pull the shit i need
[2012-02-02 19:55:06 UTC] <charlie> i wonder why i put all that effort in, usually i just write 'test' or "blah"
[2012-02-02 19:55:39 UTC] <aeonflux> hahaha
[2012-02-02 19:55:45 UTC] <aeonflux> sometimes you just gotta do the right thing
[2012-02-02 19:55:48 UTC] <aeonflux> for personal amusement
[2012-02-02 19:55:59 UTC] <aeonflux> or you were just in a verbose mood

[2012-02-02 19:57:36 UTC] <aeonflux> i'm turning this high falutin IDE black and i am gonna CODE
[2012-02-02 19:57:37 UTC] <aeonflux> :)
[2012-02-02 19:57:45 UTC] <aeonflux> that's why i miss as3 so much
[2012-02-02 19:57:51 UTC] <aeonflux> jsut really cute succinct oop
[2012-02-02 19:57:55 UTC] <charlie> when you realize like "oh man, i could totally abstract this and bubble that shit up to the parent class"

[2012-02-02 19:58:31 UTC] <charlie> yep.  it actually has a totally fair OOP class model
[2012-02-02 19:58:35 UTC] <aeonflux> just get to extend superclasses
[2012-02-02 19:58:36 UTC] <aeonflux> wow
[2012-02-02 19:58:41 UTC] <charlie> with interfaces and abstracts and everything
[2012-02-02 19:58:43 UTC] <aeonflux> php is a very realistic language
[2012-02-02 19:58:48 UTC] <charlie> you know
[2012-02-02 19:58:51 UTC] <charlie> i know why people hate it

[2012-02-02 20:00:52 UTC] <aeonflux> like if you sit for like 3 years, they'll move one frame
[2012-02-02 20:01:02 UTC] <charlie> HA!
[2012-02-02 20:01:04 UTC] <charlie> oh fuck
[2012-02-02 20:01:13 UTC] <charlie> what's the longest you can make an animated gif delay frames?
[2012-02-02 20:01:23 UTC] <aeonflux> INFINITE
[2012-02-02 20:01:25 UTC] <aeonflux> i mean

[2012-02-02 20:03:43 UTC] <aeonflux> with a little ui
[2012-02-02 20:03:50 UTC] <charlie> oh i mean the frame delay
[2012-02-02 20:03:52 UTC] <charlie> is it in seconds?
[2012-02-02 20:03:54 UTC] <aeonflux> ooh seconds
[2012-02-02 20:03:54 UTC] <aeonflux> yea
[2012-02-02 20:03:55 UTC] <charlie> or milliseconds?
[2012-02-02 20:04:20 UTC] <charlie> man, i love our irc server.
[2012-02-02 20:04:30 UTC] <charlie> we should probably start a pivotal dude.
[2012-02-02 20:04:32 UTC] <aeonflux> me too
[2012-02-02 20:04:44 UTC] <aeonflux> hm, that's that project management software, right?
[2012-02-02 20:05:04 UTC] <charlie> i need to get this thing properly daemonized, and in general just like, figure out the way i'm going to set up a node environment on my dreamhost ps server
[2012-02-02 20:05:17 UTC] <charlie> it's pretty awesome, i think i only pay $5/mo
[2012-02-02 20:05:31 UTC] <charlie> and i get a tiny little slice basically, with 384mb ram
[2012-02-02 20:05:47 UTC] <charlie> and i think infinite storage, and i can run background processes and stuff.  it's great
[2012-02-02 20:05:59 UTC] <charlie> we could handily run the big red button server on it
[2012-02-02 20:06:03 UTC] <aeonflux> :)
[2012-02-02 20:06:28 UTC] <aeonflux> let's start figuring out the node.js thing tonight
[2012-02-02 20:06:35 UTC] <charlie> ok. 
[2012-02-02 20:06:39 UTC] <aeonflux> i'm gonna try to finish our baby db models today
[2012-02-02 20:06:41 UTC] <charlie> i mean, that's what this irc server is running on now
[2012-02-02 20:06:45 UTC] <charlie> the bot too
[2012-02-02 20:07:00 UTC] <charlie> but yeah i need to figure out like, a little watchdog cron job or something just to kick it if it dies
[2012-02-02 20:07:04 UTC] <aeonflux> i need to SEE it
[2012-02-02 20:07:10 UTC] <aeonflux> i don't totally believe node.js exists
[2012-02-02 20:07:10 UTC] <charlie> yeah i'll make you an account
[2012-02-02 20:07:18 UTC] <aeonflux> :)
[2012-02-02 20:07:29 UTC] <charlie> ugh, still no raspberry pi
[2012-02-02 20:07:32 UTC] <charlie> i want it so bad ashley
[2012-02-02 20:07:39 UTC] <charlie> if they'd let me i'd just buy 8 of them the first day
[2012-02-02 20:07:52 UTC] <charlie> $200 for 8 little embedded linux boxes
[2012-02-02 20:07:56 UTC] <aeonflux> oh, they'll let you eventually
[2012-02-02 20:08:02 UTC] <charlie> these things dude.
[2012-02-02 20:08:11 UTC] <aeonflux> money WILL be exchanged for goods and services!!!!
[2012-02-02 20:08:14 UTC] <aeonflux> brb
[2012-02-02 20:08:15 UTC] <charlie> you could reallllly do things with these things

[2012-02-02 20:13:20 UTC] <aeonflux> FINALLY
[2012-02-02 20:15:01 UTC] <charlie> you can run GL on them in 1080p dude
[2012-02-02 20:15:17 UTC] <charlie> you could build such sick installations for so cheap suddenly
[2012-02-02 20:16:57 UTC] <aeonflux> I'm kindof surprised i haven't been hearing about them from anyone else
[2012-02-02 20:17:05 UTC] <aeonflux> it's just you and my wsj friend erin
[2012-02-02 20:17:13 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-02 20:17:15 UTC] <charlie> i mean
[2012-02-02 20:17:24 UTC] <charlie> if they actually exist at this pricepoint
[2012-02-02 20:17:32 UTC] <charlie> they're going to just be god damned enormous
[2012-02-02 20:17:34 UTC] <aeonflux> which means like out of the gate the first couple projects are gonna be NUTS
[2012-02-02 20:17:39 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-02 20:18:05 UTC] <charlie> fuck!
[2012-02-02 20:18:08 UTC] <charlie> robotics projects
[2012-02-02 20:18:11 UTC] <charlie> would be so awesome on those
[2012-02-02 20:18:25 UTC] <charlie> it's just like, opening up that realm of processing to far, FAR easier programming environments
[2012-02-02 20:18:45 UTC] <charlie> build a little stepper motor controller, hack out a python library for talking to it through the gpio pins
[2012-02-02 20:20:03 UTC] <aeonflux> ugh
[2012-02-02 20:20:07 UTC] <aeonflux> it's gonna be way too easy

[2012-02-03 20:49:50 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> hahaha
[2012-02-03 20:49:55 UTC] <flimshaw> it's been like a vague backburner thing for me

[2012-02-03 20:50:25 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> :) it's like, wicked sexy when you do stuff that adults do

[2012-02-03 20:50:47 UTC] <flimshaw> pull one
[2012-02-03 20:50:55 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> which is to say, to speak with little filter and make vast generalizations, most likely about gender
[2012-02-03 20:51:02 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> i think guys take a lot longer to figure that stuff out
[2012-02-03 20:51:18 UTC] <flimshaw> i'd say that's true more often than it's not
[2012-02-03 20:51:19 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> the whole like, being an adult thing along with feeling like an awesome weirdo about yourself
[2012-02-03 20:51:39 UTC] <flimshaw> financial responsibility isn't one of my strong suits
[2012-02-03 20:51:43 UTC] <flimshaw> i mean, that said
[2012-02-03 20:51:45 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> the shit-together clock in a dude's brain is just wound a little loosely or something
[2012-02-03 20:51:47 UTC] <flimshaw> i think i'm doing pretty awesome
[2012-02-03 20:51:54 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> i would agree :)
[2012-02-03 20:51:55 UTC] <flimshaw> but it's just like, i'm in the temperate zone
[2012-02-03 20:52:03 UTC] <flimshaw> and so haven't taken any like, steps to look ahead
[2012-02-03 20:52:19 UTC] <flimshaw> it's been more like a dreamy cushion of money that just seems to always be there
[2012-02-03 20:52:31 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> i'm saying this because i would put you in the better part of the bell curve for shit-togetherness
[2012-02-03 20:52:40 UTC] <flimshaw> thank you.
[2012-02-03 20:52:43 UTC] <flimshaw> yeah dude

[2012-02-03 20:54:26 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> i think i remember they had little like 'profiles' for asset allocation
[2012-02-03 20:54:34 UTC] <flimshaw> yeah i started reading about that
[2012-02-03 20:54:37 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> like oh you're some person with a decent income in their 20s, use this one!
[2012-02-03 20:54:44 UTC] <flimshaw> and was like "eh, this is for later"
[2012-02-03 20:54:53 UTC] <flimshaw> i have it all in something like moderately safe now
[2012-02-03 20:54:57 UTC] <flimshaw> but will be diversifying
[2012-02-03 20:54:59 UTC] <flimshaw> but yeah i have like 4k
[2012-02-03 20:55:00 UTC] <flimshaw> haha

[2012-02-03 20:55:30 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> yeah the ira thing was like a big lie
[2012-02-03 20:55:33 UTC] <flimshaw> i know!
[2012-02-03 20:55:35 UTC] <flimshaw> wtf
[2012-02-03 20:55:36 UTC] <flimshaw> haha
[2012-02-03 20:55:43 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> i have had like 0.05% growth in mine
[2012-02-03 20:55:46 UTC] <flimshaw> in the back of my mind ashley
[2012-02-03 20:55:53 UTC] <flimshaw> i have this sneaking suspicion 
[2012-02-03 20:56:00 UTC] <flimshaw> that financial institutions are selling me snake oil
[2012-02-03 20:56:00 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> ive just been buying muni bonds for the last year
[2012-02-03 20:56:03 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> hahahaha
[2012-02-03 20:56:04 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> they are!
[2012-02-03 20:56:05 UTC] <flimshaw> and that in 25 years when i want this money
[2012-02-03 20:56:11 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> well here's my pragmatic look at it
[2012-02-03 20:56:14 UTC] <flimshaw> it'll be like "oh hey guess what? IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING ANYMORE!"
[2012-02-03 20:56:33 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> if the banks don't fail, that money will be mine eventually, and it'll be fine
[2012-02-03 20:56:33 UTC] <flimshaw> "INFLATION AND COLLAPSING DOLLAR RUINED IT! NOW YOU CAN ONLY BUY A CAN OF COKE FOR THE $500K YOU PUT AWAY"
[2012-02-03 20:56:38 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> hahahahaha
[2012-02-03 20:56:39 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> yep!
[2012-02-03 20:56:43 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> but like
[2012-02-03 20:56:46 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> as long as i'm not missing it
[2012-02-03 20:56:48 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> i don't really care
[2012-02-03 20:56:53 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> if the banks FAIL
[2012-02-03 20:56:56 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> if america FAILS
[2012-02-03 20:56:57 UTC] <flimshaw> which has been my half baked reason for just buying convertibles instead
[2012-02-03 20:56:58 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> then who cares!
[2012-02-03 20:57:10 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> hahahaha
[2012-02-03 20:57:14 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> well that's just good sense
[2012-02-03 20:57:21 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> dude i am pro you buying convertibles
[2012-02-03 20:57:22 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> haha
[2012-02-03 20:57:40 UTC] <flimshaw> but yeah i dunno, it's cool. and i did the math
[2012-02-03 20:57:47 UTC] <flimshaw> and it's like $300 off my paycheck
[2012-02-03 20:57:50 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> but there is at least a 50% chance that saving money will "Work"
[2012-02-03 20:57:52 UTC] <flimshaw> which i feel like i won't even notice
[2012-02-03 20:57:55 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> yeah totally
[2012-02-03 20:57:58 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> you definitely won't
[2012-02-03 20:58:24 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> if you're coming within $300 of your paycheck every month then that's a different issue
[2012-02-03 20:58:33 UTC] <flimshaw> yeah, i was doing some math and i think i won't
[2012-02-03 20:58:39 UTC] <flimshaw> by a long shot
[2012-02-03 20:58:43 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> you should ask your dad to like, teach you stuff
[2012-02-03 20:58:59 UTC] <flimshaw> as long as i don't buy any DSLRs this month
[2012-02-03 20:59:00 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> i feel like it's a real dad thing to teach basic financial bullshit
[2012-02-03 20:59:03 UTC] <ashleylovespizza> hahahaha
[2012-02-03 20:59:08 UTC] <flimshaw> that's the thing

[2012-02-06 21:42:44 UTC] <charlie> back when digital photo was still like, clearly inferior to film
[2012-02-06 21:42:49 UTC] <aeonflux> as in, prints taken with real film?
[2012-02-06 21:42:55 UTC] <aeonflux> vs prints from a digital camera?
[2012-02-06 21:42:59 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-06 21:43:01 UTC] <aeonflux> definitely
[2012-02-06 21:43:03 UTC] <charlie> he had a big philosophical debate
[2012-02-06 21:43:05 UTC] <charlie> basically like
[2012-02-06 21:43:07 UTC] <charlie> photograph
[2012-02-06 21:43:10 UTC] <charlie> means to write with light
[2012-02-06 21:43:19 UTC] <charlie> and that's like, literally what's happening in old photos
[2012-02-06 21:43:25 UTC] <charlie> that are actually processed
[2012-02-06 21:43:34 UTC] <charlie> but digital is an abstraction of it, a detailed one, sure
[2012-02-06 21:43:35 UTC] <aeonflux> ah yes
[2012-02-06 21:43:44 UTC] <charlie> but it's not the actual like, burn of the light from the scene
[2012-02-06 21:44:06 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah
[2012-02-06 21:44:10 UTC] <aeonflux> i mean, it's different for sure
[2012-02-06 21:44:18 UTC] <aeonflux> no matter how granular you get
[2012-02-06 21:44:29 UTC] <aeonflux> it's like how you can't have the smallest possible slice of an abstraction
[2012-02-06 21:44:56 UTC] <aeonflux> the first time i got the concept of infinity was in 7th grade precalc
[2012-02-06 21:45:04 UTC] <aeonflux> and the teacher was like, how small a slice can you make in a circle?
[2012-02-06 21:45:13 UTC] <aeonflux> and for the first time ig ot the whole like, conceptual infinite zoom thing
[2012-02-06 21:45:26 UTC] <aeonflux> anyway, with digital, there's always eventually gonna be one binary chunk that is the smallest slice
[2012-02-06 21:45:42 UTC] <aeonflux> and with light, theres probably in practicality a smallest step, but it's more theoretical and organic, right?
[2012-02-06 21:46:06 UTC] <aeonflux> or i dunno, i could be wrong about how that whole process works
[2012-02-06 21:46:18 UTC] <charlie> well there's little silver flecks
[2012-02-06 21:46:23 UTC] <aeonflux> anyway - they do feel different to me, but one's not clearly inferior 
[2012-02-06 21:46:31 UTC] <aeonflux> but you get a different flavor of output
[2012-02-06 21:46:37 UTC] <charlie> for sure
[2012-02-06 21:46:41 UTC] <charlie> and DEFINITELY more information still
[2012-02-06 21:46:42 UTC] <charlie> in film
[2012-02-06 21:46:44 UTC] <aeonflux> in my opinion
[2012-02-06 21:46:50 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah
[2012-02-06 21:46:53 UTC] <charlie> apparently fuji makes this film
[2012-02-06 21:46:56 UTC] <charlie> Velvia 50
[2012-02-06 21:46:59 UTC] <charlie> that's 50 iso 35mm
[2012-02-06 21:47:01 UTC] <aeonflux> delicious
[2012-02-06 21:47:06 UTC] <charlie> i know
[2012-02-06 21:47:09 UTC] <charlie> it sounds so creamy
[2012-02-06 21:47:11 UTC] <charlie> but!
[2012-02-06 21:47:20 UTC] <charlie> it's rated for 160 lines per millimeter
[2012-02-06 21:47:35 UTC] <charlie> which if you do the math apparently works out to 87 megapixels
[2012-02-06 21:47:47 UTC] <charlie> my camera shoots 18
[2012-02-06 21:48:20 UTC] <charlie> but that said, i mean, lenses are limited too
[2012-02-06 21:48:36 UTC] <charlie> you'd need a CRAZY lens to focus clearly enough to make that kind of resolution really worth it
[2012-02-06 21:50:08 UTC] <aeonflux> cripes
[2012-02-06 21:50:11 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah
[2012-02-06 21:50:20 UTC] <charlie> and man, tadge's film
[2012-02-06 21:50:22 UTC] <charlie> like 4x5
[2012-02-06 21:50:39 UTC] <aeonflux> it's funny like - we've always been pushing the limits of what technology can do - it can just do so much now it's starting to feel a little silly
[2012-02-06 21:50:40 UTC] <charlie> it'll definitely be over a decade at a minimum before we get anywhere close to that
[2012-02-06 21:50:47 UTC] <aeonflux> oh cripes yeah don't get me started on that shit
[2012-02-06 21:50:52 UTC] <aeonflux> so beautiful
[2012-02-06 21:50:57 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-06 21:51:04 UTC] <charlie> but then you've got the iphone 4s cam
[2012-02-06 21:51:11 UTC] <aeonflux> when he started to like only work in 4x5 it was like, oh, cheat code!
[2012-02-06 21:51:13 UTC] <charlie> you could fit 5 of those sensors on your fingernail
[2012-02-06 21:51:20 UTC] <aeonflux> ha! yes
[2012-02-06 21:51:25 UTC] <charlie> and it shoots what, 8MP?
[2012-02-06 21:51:32 UTC] <charlie> you're right
[2012-02-06 21:51:33 UTC] <charlie> it is silly.
[2012-02-06 21:51:57 UTC] <charlie> and the way we feel about tech is different too
[2012-02-06 21:52:02 UTC] <aeonflux> http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/cell-phone-lenses/
[2012-02-06 21:52:03 UTC] <charlie> it used to be "man, someday if they figure this out"
[2012-02-06 21:52:05 UTC] <aeonflux> have you seen these?
[2012-02-06 21:52:08 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah!
[2012-02-06 21:52:12 UTC] <aeonflux> "someday!"
[2012-02-06 21:52:13 UTC] <charlie> and now it's like "well, in a year or two when they make this 10x better"
[2012-02-06 21:52:21 UTC] <aeonflux> hahahaha
[2012-02-06 21:52:23 UTC] <charlie> we're just waiting
[2012-02-06 21:52:29 UTC] <aeonflux> i used to just flat out not believe moore's law
[2012-02-06 21:52:29 UTC] <charlie> like pavlov's dogs
[2012-02-06 21:52:33 UTC] <aeonflux> like sorry guys, not happening
[2012-02-06 21:52:35 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-06 21:52:37 UTC] <charlie> and yet...
[2012-02-06 21:52:40 UTC] <aeonflux> ram is gonna tap out
[2012-02-06 21:52:46 UTC] <aeonflux> there are physical restrictions that prevent this
[2012-02-06 21:52:49 UTC] <aeonflux> but....
[2012-02-06 21:52:50 UTC] <aeonflux> but….yeah
[2012-02-06 21:52:52 UTC] <aeonflux> hahahaha
[2012-02-06 21:53:03 UTC] <aeonflux> SO this photojojo thing
[2012-02-06 21:53:08 UTC] <charlie> wow.
[2012-02-06 21:53:13 UTC] <charlie> $50 for all 3 is fairly cheap
[2012-02-06 21:53:17 UTC] <aeonflux> is made by this guy amit pitaru and a couple other sweet nerds that tim hwang and rick are friends with
[2012-02-06 21:53:20 UTC] <aeonflux> so what i was thinking was
[2012-02-06 21:53:28 UTC] <charlie> wait really?
[2012-02-06 21:53:28 UTC] <aeonflux> you could get some kind of sweet deal and work with them on something going forward
[2012-02-06 21:53:31 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah!
[2012-02-06 21:53:35 UTC] <charlie> ashley
[2012-02-06 21:53:36 UTC] <charlie> god damn
[2012-02-06 21:53:38 UTC] <aeonflux> <3
[2012-02-06 21:53:42 UTC] <charlie> <3
[2012-02-06 21:53:45 UTC] <aeonflux> :) :) 
[2012-02-06 21:53:46 UTC] <aeonflux> as;ldjfalsdf
[2012-02-06 21:53:56 UTC] <charlie> we are going to have so much fun
[2012-02-06 21:53:57 UTC] <charlie> TAKING OVER EARTH
[2012-02-06 21:53:59 UTC] <aeonflux> HAHAHAHA
[2012-02-06 21:54:00 UTC] <aeonflux> AS:DJLFAKLSJDFLKSAF
[2012-02-06 21:54:07 UTC] <aeonflux> that is EXACTLY THE FEELING
[2012-02-06 21:54:13 UTC] <charlie> hahah
[2012-02-06 21:54:16 UTC] <charlie> fuuuuuck
[2012-02-06 21:54:18 UTC] <charlie> man
[2012-02-06 21:54:18 UTC] <charlie> dmanit
[2012-02-06 21:54:20 UTC] <charlie> hahaa
[2012-02-06 21:54:24 UTC] <aeonflux> HEH
[2012-02-06 21:54:24 UTC] <charlie> i just got this pang
[2012-02-06 21:54:43 UTC] <charlie> of like "LET'S HANG OUT WITH ASHLEY AND LOOK AT DATASHEETS FOR CAMERA SENSORS!"
[2012-02-06 21:54:43 UTC] <aeonflux> an NPI mystery roar?
[2012-02-06 21:54:49 UTC] <aeonflux> HAHAHA
[2012-02-06 21:54:57 UTC] <aeonflux> ah excellent
[2012-02-06 21:54:59 UTC] <charlie> but wow
[2012-02-06 21:55:01 UTC] <charlie> yeah that's nice
[2012-02-06 21:55:04 UTC] <charlie> so you happen to know a guy
[2012-02-06 21:55:05 UTC] <aeonflux> my brain conditioning has been coming along nicely
[2012-02-06 21:55:09 UTC] <charlie> who makes precisely the device i require
[2012-02-06 21:55:15 UTC] <aeonflux> right!
[2012-02-06 21:55:17 UTC] <charlie> that is pretty ok.
[2012-02-06 21:55:25 UTC] <charlie> so
[2012-02-06 21:55:27 UTC] <aeonflux> or who you could talk to about developing the exact device you need
[2012-02-06 21:55:29 UTC] <charlie> how can i get in touch with them
[2012-02-06 21:55:33 UTC] <aeonflux> hmm
[2012-02-06 21:55:35 UTC] <aeonflux> lemme think
[2012-02-06 21:55:35 UTC] <charlie> this is a great place to star
[2012-02-06 21:55:44 UTC] <charlie> what i really need though is a tiny pinhole version
[2012-02-06 21:55:49 UTC] <aeonflux> i would maybe ask rick to introduce you?
[2012-02-06 21:55:55 UTC] <aeonflux> how bout this
[2012-02-06 21:56:14 UTC] <aeonflux> when we hang with rick and emma in nyc we can chat about it then maybe?
[2012-02-06 21:56:18 UTC] <aeonflux> some of those guys are in nyc
[2012-02-06 21:56:29 UTC] <charlie> oh lovely
[2012-02-06 21:56:32 UTC] <aeonflux> it's tricky like - amit was diagnosed with leukemia recently, but he found a match (!)
[2012-02-06 21:56:39 UTC] <aeonflux> but in the meantime i'm not sure what's happening to photojojo
[2012-02-06 21:56:45 UTC] <aeonflux> i think he had some other biz partners
[2012-02-06 21:56:55 UTC] <aeonflux> anyway, rick may well be a fucking investor for all i know
[2012-02-06 21:57:06 UTC] <aeonflux> so yeah either get rick or tim hwang to introduce you
[2012-02-06 21:57:27 UTC] <aeonflux> this chick diana kimball i think was either working with them or just closely helping out in the early phases
[2012-02-06 21:57:31 UTC] <aeonflux> and diana is tim's bff
[2012-02-06 21:57:54 UTC] <aeonflux> these are all people who are just like, 0.5 a degree too far away from me for me to do the introducing and have it make sense
[2012-02-06 21:58:07 UTC] <aeonflux> anyway, you're gold, basically
[2012-02-06 21:58:42 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-06 21:58:59 UTC] <charlie> yeah i pinged tim about drinks
[2012-02-06 21:59:09 UTC] <charlie> maybe i'll run it by him like "hey know any good lens dudes?"
[2012-02-06 22:00:23 UTC] <aeonflux> haha
[2012-02-06 22:00:31 UTC] <aeonflux> "know any photography startups?"
[2012-02-06 22:00:39 UTC] <aeonflux> "oh you DO???"
[2012-02-06 22:00:45 UTC] <charlie> hah
[2012-02-06 22:00:51 UTC] <charlie> what a co-ink!
[2012-02-06 22:00:57 UTC] <aeonflux> heeheee
[2012-02-06 22:01:02 UTC] <charlie> i have a pretty specific application thuogh
[2012-02-06 22:01:12 UTC] <charlie> do they know anything about fish eye lenses on something cellphone sized?
[2012-02-06 22:01:21 UTC] <charlie> oh you DON'T SAY!
[2012-02-06 22:02:12 UTC] <charlie> http://bydit.com/doce/products/Opto-electronics/CameraModule/
[2012-02-06 22:02:58 UTC] <charlie> i think this is the time for this device, yo
[2012-02-06 22:03:02 UTC] <charlie> it's POSSIBLE
[2012-02-06 22:03:12 UTC] <charlie> that with the super crazy cheap gl/embedded graphics stuff that's happening
[2012-02-06 22:03:27 UTC] <charlie> i could even PERHAPS render live stitched video, if i did the stitching in GL
[2012-02-06 22:03:49 UTC] <charlie> which is something i've been thinking about a lot, it would speed this shit up so much
[2012-02-06 22:04:03 UTC] <charlie> it's so fun!  it' just like
[2012-02-06 22:04:19 UTC] <charlie> a thing that is really hard to do with computers, it kinda is pushing them to about the limits of what they could do right now
[2012-02-06 22:04:46 UTC] <charlie> i'm trying to find the amazing sensors i was looking at before but i can't track 'em down
[2012-02-06 22:15:22 UTC] <charlie> ok found 'em, http://www.ovt.com/
[2012-02-06 22:15:31 UTC] <charlie> they're in Santa Clara, CA apparently 
[2012-02-06 22:18:44 UTC] <charlie> and these would fit i think: http://www.optics-online.com/dsl_quarter.asp but they're bigger than i'd like
[2012-02-06 22:26:54 UTC] <aeonflux> oh lord
[2012-02-06 22:26:54 UTC] <aeonflux> yes
[2012-02-06 22:27:05 UTC] <aeonflux> and everyone is obsessed with life recording
[2012-02-06 22:27:08 UTC] <aeonflux> obvss
[2012-02-06 22:27:14 UTC] <charlie> except us
[2012-02-06 22:27:16 UTC] <charlie> oh wait
[2012-02-06 22:28:11 UTC] <aeonflux> oh wait.
[2012-02-06 22:28:13 UTC] <aeonflux> dude yeah
[2012-02-06 22:28:15 UTC] <aeonflux> ha
[2012-02-06 22:28:34 UTC] <aeonflux> i was like somewhat forcibly against over-life-recording the last few years
[2012-02-06 22:29:14 UTC] <aeonflux> and i realized recently it's the ovesharing i'm against
[2012-02-06 22:29:16 UTC] <aeonflux> record EVERYTHING
[2012-02-06 22:29:23 UTC] <aeonflux> just don't post it to facebook automatically
[2012-02-06 22:29:27 UTC] <charlie> exactly.
[2012-02-06 22:31:08 UTC] <charlie> haha.  man.
[2012-02-06 22:31:16 UTC] <charlie> i haven't dug into a datasheet hole for a while
[2012-02-06 22:31:24 UTC] <charlie> i'll admit to you, ashley, it makes me feel like a badass
[2012-02-06 22:38:33 UTC] <aeonflux> it should
[2012-02-06 22:38:36 UTC] <aeonflux> i just had to google datasheet
[2012-02-06 22:39:00 UTC] <aeonflux> i have seen these before but i didn't know there was like, a name for them
[2012-02-06 22:39:05 UTC] <aeonflux> a new category of Thing
[2012-02-06 22:40:04 UTC] <charlie> they're pretty great
[2012-02-06 22:40:14 UTC] <charlie> and terrifying
[2012-02-06 22:40:23 UTC] <aeonflux> haha
[2012-02-06 22:40:31 UTC] <aeonflux> they appeal to a certain part of my brain
[2012-02-06 22:40:44 UTC] <charlie> you know what they do for me?
[2012-02-06 22:40:45 UTC] <charlie> i just realized it
[2012-02-06 22:40:53 UTC] <aeonflux> it's the part that i picture looking like when the sea king in the little mermaid gets turned into a little plant guy
[2012-02-06 22:40:54 UTC] <aeonflux> what?
[2012-02-06 22:41:06 UTC] <charlie> i feel a kinship with the people i've never met who make the things i use all day
[2012-02-06 22:41:35 UTC] <charlie> it's like "ohhhhh, wow.  my phone's basically made up of like, 30 chips with docs like this"
[2012-02-06 22:41:56 UTC] <charlie> "you plug 'em all together and write some code and at the end you have a phone"
[2012-02-06 22:42:05 UTC] <charlie> it takes a little of the mystery out of it
[2012-02-06 22:42:05 UTC] <aeonflux> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_bDpg9dX2RY0/TFcWhjJfUkI/AAAAAAAABmI/7rgmpyUOlIA/s1600/king+triton.jpg
[2012-02-06 22:42:11 UTC] <aeonflux> awww
[2012-02-06 22:42:13 UTC] <aeonflux> that's awesome!
[2012-02-06 22:42:15 UTC] <aeonflux> i love that :)
[2012-02-06 22:42:25 UTC] <aeonflux> that's the thing man
[2012-02-06 22:42:35 UTC] <aeonflux> any of this stuff is not really so mystifying
[2012-02-06 22:42:50 UTC] <aeonflux> you just progressively break it down into more and more detailed explanations
[2012-02-06 22:43:04 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-06 22:43:07 UTC] <charlie> multiplexing!
[2012-02-06 22:43:08 UTC] <aeonflux> but for hardware stuff i don't really grok itmakes sense
[2012-02-06 22:43:13 UTC] <aeonflux> like here's a bunch of black boxes
[2012-02-06 22:43:20 UTC] <aeonflux> and here's some info about em
[2012-02-06 22:43:28 UTC] <charlie> yeah who KNOWS what's happening inside
[2012-02-06 22:43:29 UTC] <aeonflux> Start Here
[2012-02-06 22:43:44 UTC] <charlie> but if i put electricity and data in, i get other data out right?
[2012-02-06 22:43:46 UTC] <charlie> ok cool
[2012-02-06 22:43:51 UTC] <aeonflux> i always get caught up like AUGH I CAN'T WRITE X86 WHY AM I EVEN BOTHERING
[2012-02-06 22:43:58 UTC] <aeonflux> yeah!
[2012-02-06 22:44:07 UTC] <aeonflux> just the right i/o pathway is all you need
[2012-02-06 22:44:10 UTC] <aeonflux> charlie you're so awesome
[2012-02-06 22:44:22 UTC] <charlie> they make h.264 encoder chips that you just plug a camera into
[2012-02-06 22:44:28 UTC] <charlie> dudd
[2012-02-06 22:44:28 UTC] <charlie> e
[2012-02-06 22:44:30 UTC] <charlie> ugh
[2012-02-06 22:44:34 UTC] <charlie> you have no idea how like
[2012-02-06 22:44:40 UTC] <charlie> fuckin' warm it feels
[2012-02-06 22:44:43 UTC] <charlie> to talk tech with you.

[2012-02-06 22:45:41 UTC] <aeonflux> i feel like
[2012-02-06 22:46:29 UTC] <aeonflux> just being able to get the broad strokes pretty quickly, notice patterns, put it together ina  gestalt that makes sense with the larger lessons we've learned (even though it could be totally different on the current project/language/framework/whatever)
[2012-02-06 22:46:52 UTC] <aeonflux> it's why i get mad when andrew bell makes fun of web developers
[2012-02-06 22:47:03 UTC] <charlie> haha

[2012-02-06 22:47:26 UTC] <aeonflux> like oh, and knowing C++ like stroustrup's disciple is such a big screaming deal
[2012-02-06 22:47:31 UTC] <aeonflux> (it is)
[2012-02-06 22:47:36 UTC] <aeonflux> but it's just different

[2012-02-06 22:50:16 UTC] <aeonflux> it's just a little too much to think about over the next 2 weeks
[2012-02-06 22:50:24 UTC] <aeonflux> and i'm helping sean with AV for the lifestyle show on saturday
[2012-02-06 22:50:29 UTC] <aeonflux> like, man

[2012-02-06 22:50:55 UTC] <charlie> yeah it'll be rough at times.
[2012-02-06 22:50:57 UTC] <aeonflux> oh but yeah i mentioned how you come back to boston in the summer
[2012-02-06 22:51:04 UTC] <aeonflux> and that youwere working on a boat in plymouth
[2012-02-06 22:51:14 UTC] <aeonflux> and she was like, yeah, that's pretty hot when a guy has skills like that
[2012-02-06 22:51:40 UTC] <aeonflux> "… but at the same time you'd probably be fine if he just sat around on his butt because you just have such good conversations"
[2012-02-06 22:51:43 UTC] <aeonflux> and i was like, hmmm
[2012-02-06 22:51:45 UTC] <aeonflux> interesting concept
[2012-02-06 22:51:56 UTC] <aeonflux> i cannot conceive of a charlie who sits around on any of his body parts
[2012-02-06 22:52:06 UTC] <aeonflux> i mean, like we said, we're not always gonna be this motivated
[2012-02-06 22:52:31 UTC] <aeonflux> there will come a month or two or three period where the project will be watching all of Dr Who
[2012-02-06 22:52:37 UTC] <aeonflux> but yeah
[2012-02-06 22:52:43 UTC] <aeonflux> i really really really like how your brain works

[2012-02-06 23:05:37 UTC] <charlie> we don't have to sell our dreams
[2012-02-06 23:05:50 UTC] <charlie> we could call it something else
[2012-02-06 23:05:50 UTC] <aeonflux> the first thing on there is a little triptych travelguide style thing on how to have a fucking amazing weekend
[2012-02-06 23:05:57 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-06 23:06:15 UTC] <charlie> i just think we could make awesome stuff
[2012-02-06 23:06:17 UTC] <aeonflux> with illustrative holograms and a fully rolled joint included
[2012-02-06 23:06:20 UTC] <charlie> that people would want
[2012-02-06 23:06:20 UTC] <aeonflux> oh definitely
[2012-02-06 23:06:28 UTC] <charlie> i mean, rick webb
[2012-02-06 23:06:34 UTC] <aeonflux> at least the photojojo set will want

[2012-02-06 23:06:45 UTC] <aeonflux> definitely
[2012-02-06 23:06:57 UTC] <charlie> see if we can hit the $99 pricepoint
[2012-02-06 23:07:08 UTC] <charlie> i figured we could just have it start up with an ad-hoc wifi network you connect to
[2012-02-06 23:07:10 UTC] <charlie> then configure in a browser
[2012-02-06 23:07:42 UTC] <charlie> but yeah, i agree, i think raspi's gonna really be huge
[2012-02-06 23:09:16 UTC] <aeonflux> you also have to make that like, walkabout fitbit human passive proxy thinger you were talking about
[2012-02-06 23:09:21 UTC] <aeonflux> at the very least as an art project
[2012-02-06 23:09:29 UTC] <aeonflux> i mean, you don't have to
[2012-02-06 23:09:41 UTC] <aeonflux> but the world will be better if you do
[2012-02-06 23:11:04 UTC] <aeonflux> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmq9dq6Nsg for some reason this is just hitting the spot right now

[2012-02-06 23:23:28 UTC] <charlie> maybe that's a better place to start, way way simpler than the camera
[2012-02-06 23:24:11 UTC] <charlie> just gotta make a little thing you can throw in a backpack with a zigbee transceiver and a usb port and some kinda storage
[2012-02-06 23:24:48 UTC] <charlie> zigbee transceiver chips are like, nothing too, < $10 a piece, like, $3 in bulk
[2012-02-06 23:24:55 UTC] <charlie> bah
[2012-02-07 00:00:33 UTC] <aeonflux> hm maybe something like the altoid thinger you built?

[2012-02-07 00:32:40 UTC] <aeonflux> everything seemed actually more color saturated
[2012-02-07 00:32:45 UTC] <charlie> oh well
[2012-02-07 00:32:48 UTC] <charlie> that's because you were in california

[2012-02-07 00:33:41 UTC] <aeonflux> oh we use all the brown bits here
[2012-02-07 00:33:52 UTC] <aeonflux> the blue-grey ones are fully flushed out too
[2012-02-07 00:34:15 UTC] <charlie> man, i'm on a real little bitch of a bug
[2012-02-07 00:34:35 UTC] <charlie> don't you hate when some tiny thing just takes hours to track down?
[2012-02-07 00:37:08 UTC] <charlie> ah, leading zeroes on the date
[2012-02-07 00:37:16 UTC] <charlie> that'll do it
[2012-02-07 00:37:21 UTC] <aeonflux> augh

[2012-02-07 00:37:29 UTC] <charlie> i like to catch mitch's eye
[2012-02-07 00:37:34 UTC] <charlie> and tell him how i solved it
[2012-02-07 00:37:37 UTC] <charlie> with no context whatsoever
[2012-02-07 00:37:40 UTC] <aeonflux> HAHAHA
[2012-02-07 00:37:42 UTC] <charlie> like just now
[2012-02-07 00:37:46 UTC] <aeonflux> that's lovely
[2012-02-07 00:37:52 UTC] <charlie> "ah, it was the leading zeroes, mitch!  that was the problem."
[2012-02-07 00:38:07 UTC] <charlie> and he just says "yep, knew it would be."

[2012-02-07 00:42:05 UTC] <charlie> protip
[2012-02-07 00:42:10 UTC] <charlie> sprintf is the best function ever
[2012-02-07 00:42:43 UTC] <charlie> ran into this on the roadtrip stitching stuff
[2012-02-07 00:42:48 UTC] <charlie> if you ever need to add leading zeroes to something
[2012-02-07 00:43:04 UTC] <charlie> sprintf("number: %05d", numberVar)
[2012-02-07 00:43:21 UTC] <charlie> the 5 there is the number of zeroes to pad
[2012-02-07 00:43:30 UTC] <charlie> it does the rest!
[2012-02-07 00:43:39 UTC] <charlie> clarence animate me the more you know

[2012-02-07 21:55:20 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-07 21:55:27 UTC] <ashley> you can definitely build your little passive proxy guy
[2012-02-07 21:55:29 UTC] <charlie> it stands to reason that you could use the same chip their using 
[2012-02-07 21:55:29 UTC] <ashley> definitely
[2012-02-07 21:55:42 UTC] <charlie> and build something that ran a full linux stack that was tiny
[2012-02-07 21:56:00 UTC] <charlie> but still powerful enough to let you run higher level languages/libraries
[2012-02-07 21:56:12 UTC] <charlie> ugh, god damn dude, WHY ISN'T IT OUT YET

[2012-02-07 22:04:21 UTC] <ashley> well let's just get the entity banged out
[2012-02-07 22:04:25 UTC] <charlie> cool
[2012-02-07 22:05:03 UTC] <ashley> it's gonna be like, a title:varchar, type:varchar (audio, image, video, .. - which should be kept as a static macro in one of our models), and a url:varchar
[2012-02-07 22:05:09 UTC] <ashley> and the rails timestamps

[2012-02-07 22:13:23 UTC] <charlie> yeah just some articles i saw, no reason to rock the boat let's figure this entity shit out
[2012-02-07 22:13:32 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-07 22:13:34 UTC] <charlie> but might be worth looking at, i have no idea what it does or why yet
[2012-02-07 22:13:44 UTC] <ashley> well, it's worth doing silly dickhead stuff with our sideproject
[2012-02-07 22:13:53 UTC] <ashley> like, let's learn backbone.js!
[2012-02-07 22:13:55 UTC] <ashley> and mongodb!
[2012-02-07 22:13:59 UTC] <charlie> yessss

[2012-02-07 22:14:35 UTC] <charlie> we were so young when we chose that schema
[2012-02-07 22:14:51 UTC] <charlie> some of life's lessons must be learned the hard way
[2012-02-07 22:15:39 UTC] <ashley> http://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/MjAxMi04ZjcwOWJiOGEzNjA1YjA3
[2012-02-07 22:15:39 UTC] <ashley> sigh

[2012-02-07 22:16:42 UTC] <charlie> hmmm
[2012-02-07 22:17:45 UTC] <charlie> so i guess mongo is like
[2012-02-07 22:17:58 UTC] <charlie> this amoeba-like tableless mass of data
[2012-02-07 22:19:31 UTC] <charlie> interesting.
[2012-02-07 22:19:39 UTC] <charlie> entities!
[2012-02-07 22:19:44 UTC] <charlie> ashley stay on target!
[2012-02-07 22:22:27 UTC] <ashley> i'm inside the target!
[2012-02-07 22:22:34 UTC] <ashley> trying to remember routes syntax
[2012-02-07 22:40:34 UTC] <ashley> ok frig
[2012-02-07 22:40:36 UTC] <ashley> it's always somethin
[2012-02-07 22:40:39 UTC] <ashley> forgetting your git password
[2012-02-07 22:40:45 UTC] <ashley> notknowing the new routes syntax for 3.1
[2012-02-07 22:40:48 UTC] <ashley> it's pushed
[2012-02-07 22:40:51 UTC] <ashley> you got entities, kiddo
[2012-02-07 22:40:52 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-07 22:41:05 UTC] <charlie> ha
[2012-02-07 22:41:17 UTC] <charlie> there it is
[2012-02-07 22:41:19 UTC] <charlie> beautiful.
[2012-02-07 22:41:23 UTC] <ashley> i'd like to figure out the best way to structure the adapter code for our 3+ little plugin entities
[2012-02-07 22:41:30 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-07 22:41:54 UTC] <charlie> yeah so, each is different
[2012-02-07 22:42:01 UTC] <charlie> but we wanna tag them all on the same timeline
[2012-02-07 22:42:13 UTC] <ashley> right
[2012-02-07 22:42:22 UTC] <ashley> maybe there should be a lil class for each type of connection
[2012-02-07 22:42:28 UTC] <charlie> so, can we say that an entity is something that happened at a specific time
[2012-02-07 22:42:34 UTC] <charlie> and that's pretty much it
[2012-02-07 22:42:41 UTC] <charlie> ?
[2012-02-07 22:42:42 UTC] <ashley> so there's Entity < ActiveRecord::Base
[2012-02-07 22:42:47 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-07 22:42:58 UTC] <ashley> then there could be like… TwitterEntity < Entity, DropboxEntity < Entity
[2012-02-07 22:43:02 UTC] <ashley> really just to keep it organized
[2012-02-07 22:43:06 UTC] <charlie> yeah perfect
[2012-02-07 22:43:16 UTC] <charlie> and also like, we'll have some common functionality to script out that we can do in Entity
[2012-02-07 22:43:22 UTC] <ashley> right now i have some retardo twitter code in the entity controller
[2012-02-07 22:43:43 UTC] <ashley> yessir
[2012-02-07 22:43:47 UTC] <charlie> woah
[2012-02-07 22:43:57 UTC] <charlie> coooool
[2012-02-07 22:44:01 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-07 22:44:10 UTC] <ashley> you can hit /entities/gather and it'll run
[2012-02-07 22:44:22 UTC] <charlie> lemme fire her up
[2012-02-07 22:44:24 UTC] <ashley> and you can see a nice json packet of our recent tweatz in the rails server window
[2012-02-07 22:44:24 UTC] <ashley> heh
[2012-02-07 22:44:36 UTC] <ashley> i mean, nothing -happens- per se
[2012-02-07 22:44:40 UTC] <ashley> actually one sec
[2012-02-07 22:45:55 UTC] <ashley> ok just did another wee push
[2012-02-07 22:45:57 UTC] <charlie> k, i've gotta install some shit anyhow
[2012-02-07 22:46:04 UTC] <ashley> :)
[2012-02-07 22:46:06 UTC] <charlie> bundling
[2012-02-07 22:46:14 UTC] <charlie> this is fun
[2012-02-07 22:47:00 UTC] <charlie> huh, you pushed?
[2012-02-07 22:47:33 UTC] <charlie> ahhhh ok
[2012-02-07 22:47:35 UTC] <charlie> database!
[2012-02-07 22:47:43 UTC] <ashley> yeah!
[2012-02-07 22:47:47 UTC] <ashley> rake db:migrate
[2012-02-07 22:47:51 UTC] <ashley> have you done it locally?
[2012-02-07 22:48:00 UTC] <charlie> standby
[2012-02-07 22:48:12 UTC] <ashley> i haven't even thought about implementing it on a real server yet
[2012-02-07 22:48:12 UTC] <ashley> but maybe we should choose mongo v. mysql v. whatever before then
[2012-02-07 22:48:55 UTC] <charlie> i'm a'gatherin'!!
[2012-02-07 22:49:01 UTC] <ashley> haha!
[2012-02-07 22:49:02 UTC] <ashley> whee!
[2012-02-07 22:49:08 UTC] <charlie> ok
[2012-02-07 22:49:11 UTC] <charlie> dude sweeeet
[2012-02-07 22:49:12 UTC] <ashley> anyway
[2012-02-07 22:49:13 UTC] <ashley> YEAH
[2012-02-07 22:49:20 UTC] <ashley> mild, mild progress
[2012-02-07 22:49:21 UTC] <ashley> that was fun
[2012-02-07 22:49:41 UTC] <charlie> so we'd need to write something
[2012-02-07 22:49:47 UTC] <charlie> that we could just drop in a cron job
[2012-02-07 22:49:59 UTC] <charlie> that'd grab this feed every hour or whatever
[2012-02-07 22:50:06 UTC] <charlie> and read it for new entries
[2012-02-07 22:50:11 UTC] <charlie> and then create and store entities for them
[2012-02-07 22:50:30 UTC] <ashley> ah i was thinkin the idea of the big red button was that we tell it when to like, -go-
[2012-02-07 22:50:40 UTC] <ashley> but yeah
[2012-02-07 22:50:41 UTC] <ashley> same deal
[2012-02-07 22:50:45 UTC] <charlie> oh huh
[2012-02-07 22:50:48 UTC] <ashley> whether or not it's in the cron or we're hitting a GET
[2012-02-07 22:50:54 UTC] <charlie> i was thinking the big red button was just like
[2012-02-07 22:50:56 UTC] <charlie> one more entity 
[2012-02-07 22:51:00 UTC] <charlie> that gets recorded on the timeline
[2012-02-07 22:51:08 UTC] <charlie> eventually
[2012-02-07 22:51:14 UTC] <ashley> oh!
[2012-02-07 22:51:20 UTC] <ashley> that's cute
[2012-02-07 22:51:21 UTC] <ashley> hm
[2012-02-07 22:51:26 UTC] <charlie> yeah dude, we coudl record them all
[2012-02-07 22:51:32 UTC] <charlie> with a microsecond unix timestamp
[2012-02-07 22:51:46 UTC] <charlie> and then like, play them back or see them really granularly
[2012-02-07 22:51:55 UTC] <ashley> hmm
[2012-02-07 22:51:58 UTC] <ashley> i think i dig it
[2012-02-07 22:52:04 UTC] <ashley> like be able to zoom way the fuck in
[2012-02-07 22:52:11 UTC] <charlie> on those things, sure
[2012-02-07 22:52:12 UTC] <ashley> this is gonna come together semi quickly i think
[2012-02-07 22:52:14 UTC] <ashley> honestly
[2012-02-07 22:52:18 UTC] <charlie> yeah man
[2012-02-07 22:52:19 UTC] <charlie> so, ok
[2012-02-07 22:52:25 UTC] <charlie> so how about like, a scraper class
[2012-02-07 22:52:41 UTC] <charlie> for these things we're gonna want to aggregate
[2012-02-07 22:52:45 UTC] <ashley> hmm
[2012-02-07 22:52:48 UTC] <ashley> exprain
[2012-02-07 22:52:49 UTC] <charlie> does that make sense?
[2012-02-07 22:52:50 UTC] <charlie> ok
[2012-02-07 22:52:56 UTC] <charlie> i'm thinking about the way i have this app set up
[2012-02-07 22:53:04 UTC] <ashley> yeth
[2012-02-07 22:53:14 UTC] <charlie> it works pretty well, but the rails way might actually amke ti really redundant
[2012-02-07 22:53:20 UTC] <charlie> so i have all these fitness api's 
[2012-02-07 22:53:34 UTC] <charlie> and i need to store entries for miles walked, and steps taken for all of them in a universal formate
[2012-02-07 22:53:35 UTC] <charlie> *format
[2012-02-07 22:53:40 UTC] <charlie> so i have a FitnessTracker class
[2012-02-07 22:53:53 UTC] <charlie> and it's sort of the parent
[2012-02-07 22:54:08 UTC] <charlie> so there i have a method that takes a JSON object in a standardized format
[2012-02-07 22:54:20 UTC] <charlie> and either creates records in the DB from it
[2012-02-07 22:54:30 UTC] <charlie> or updates existing records if they differ with its info
[2012-02-07 22:54:34 UTC] <ashley> oh that's lovely
[2012-02-07 22:54:40 UTC] <charlie> so, the idea is
[2012-02-07 22:54:47 UTC] <charlie> like Twitter < Scraper
[2012-02-07 22:54:52 UTC] <ashley> yeah totally
[2012-02-07 22:55:01 UTC] <ashley> i love it
[2012-02-07 22:55:06 UTC] <charlie> and you write a method in Twitter that scrapes and spits out json in that standard format to the parent's functions
[2012-02-07 22:55:07 UTC] <charlie> awesome
[2012-02-07 22:55:09 UTC] <ashley> so the scraper is kindof the high level interface stuff
[2012-02-07 22:55:22 UTC] <charlie> exactly, it just handles the syncing with the database thing
[2012-02-07 22:55:24 UTC] <ashley> the active record i/o stuff with the json
[2012-02-07 22:55:41 UTC] <charlie> so, question
[2012-02-07 22:55:44 UTC] <ashley> and maybe it just has like a 'get data' method stubbed out kindof
[2012-02-07 22:55:46 UTC] <charlie> QUESTION LOVE
[2012-02-07 22:55:51 UTC] <charlie> hmm
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 UTC] <ashley> that'll be actually fleshed out in Twitter etc
[2012-02-07 22:56:11 UTC] <charlie> yep, preeeecisely
[2012-02-07 22:56:12 UTC] <ashley> QUESTIONS
[2012-02-07 22:56:17 UTC] <charlie> so the entity model itself
[2012-02-07 22:56:20 UTC] <charlie> fields:
[2012-02-07 22:56:45 UTC] <charlie> well, do you wanna have different tables for all these?
[2012-02-07 22:56:50 UTC] <ashley> hm
[2012-02-07 22:56:57 UTC] <charlie> or like, store some meta info in a json packet, and tag them differently
[2012-02-07 22:56:59 UTC] <ashley> like intermittent tables to hold shit?
[2012-02-07 22:57:12 UTC] <charlie> yeah like, is there one humungous Entities table where everything lives
[2012-02-07 22:57:21 UTC] <ashley> haha hell yes!
[2012-02-07 22:57:26 UTC] <ashley> hm
[2012-02-07 22:57:31 UTC] <charlie> with fields like
[2012-02-07 22:57:34 UTC] <charlie> id, tags, value
[2012-02-07 22:57:36 UTC] <ashley> so right now they have a type which i was thining was like audio, vidoe.etc
[2012-02-07 22:57:46 UTC] <ashley> but there should totally be a like datasource field
[2012-02-07 22:57:46 UTC] <charlie> and value could be a json obj with some meta info that you handle depending on the type
[2012-02-07 22:57:53 UTC] <ashley> so we can track that
[2012-02-07 22:58:11 UTC] <ashley> oh interesting
[2012-02-07 22:58:24 UTC] <ashley> i think that makes more sense than what i was thinking
[2012-02-07 22:58:39 UTC] <charlie> oh like, id, timestamp, tags, value
[2012-02-07 22:58:40 UTC] <ashley> which was to like, save down the most simplified shit in the code
[2012-02-07 22:58:41 UTC] <ashley> maybe
[2012-02-07 22:58:50 UTC] <charlie> hmmm
[2012-02-07 22:58:54 UTC] <ashley> so it'd be fast
[2012-02-07 22:59:01 UTC] <charlie> yeah, maybe we should use mongo dude
[2012-02-07 22:59:01 UTC] <ashley> less data processing = faster display
[2012-02-07 22:59:09 UTC] <ashley> but why not just save everything
[2012-02-07 22:59:12 UTC] <charlie> it really seems well suited to holding a whole bunch of tiny stuff
[2012-02-07 22:59:17 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-07 22:59:21 UTC] <ashley> that's npi for sure
[2012-02-07 22:59:27 UTC] <charlie> yeah totally
[2012-02-07 22:59:28 UTC] * ashley set topic to 'a whole bunch of tiny stuff'
[2012-02-07 22:59:41 UTC] <charlie> :D
[2012-02-07 22:59:50 UTC] <charlie> and it lets you define shit on the fly
[2012-02-07 22:59:51 UTC] <ashley> i love this cause the code is pretty decoupled too
[2012-02-07 23:00:03 UTC] <ashley> we can hack on little bits as we go and not step on eachother's toes
[2012-02-07 23:00:03 UTC] <charlie> yeah we can spin up new things to track pretty easily i think
[2012-02-07 23:01:00 UTC] <charlie> ok, so let's maybe start with this
[2012-02-07 23:01:02 UTC] <ashley> man
[2012-02-07 23:01:04 UTC] <charlie> migrations are pretty easy in rails right?
[2012-02-07 23:01:07 UTC] <ashley> should we switch to django?
[2012-02-07 23:01:09 UTC] <ashley> oh super easy
[2012-02-07 23:01:15 UTC] <charlie> hmm, well
[2012-02-07 23:01:27 UTC] <charlie> man, i dunno.  rails seems to have more support
[2012-02-07 23:01:35 UTC] <ashley> here's a HORRIBLE blog post about it http://www.viget.com/extend/rails-3-generators-scaffolding/
[2012-02-07 23:01:36 UTC] <charlie> python is nice though
[2012-02-07 23:01:38 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-07 23:01:40 UTC] <ashley> i dunno
[2012-02-07 23:01:48 UTC] <ashley> i feel so blase about python
[2012-02-07 23:01:51 UTC] <ashley> i know i should like it
[2012-02-07 23:02:06 UTC] <charlie> well, it's just got a lot of libraries, but i'm sure rails does too
[2012-02-07 23:02:09 UTC] <charlie> or ruby rather
[2012-02-07 23:02:14 UTC] <ashley> python, ipads, fancy coffee
[2012-02-07 23:02:16 UTC] <charlie> and it's been around for a million years
[2012-02-07 23:02:27 UTC] <ashley> well python as a scripting language is like fine
[2012-02-07 23:02:34 UTC] <ashley> but learning a whole new framework
[2012-02-07 23:02:41 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-07 23:02:46 UTC] <ashley> and all its bizarre sexy secrets
[2012-02-07 23:02:48 UTC] <charlie> i mean, rails looks very familar coming from django
[2012-02-07 23:02:51 UTC] <ashley> not sure if i'm up for that atm
[2012-02-07 23:02:55 UTC] <charlie> i'm sure vice versa would be fine
[2012-02-07 23:02:57 UTC] <charlie> let's stick with rails
[2012-02-07 23:03:01 UTC] <ashley> OK
[2012-02-07 23:03:03 UTC] <ashley> sick
[2012-02-07 23:03:04 UTC] <charlie> it'll go faster 
[2012-02-07 23:03:09 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-07 23:03:12 UTC] <ashley> it surely well
[2012-02-07 23:03:16 UTC] <ashley> bah
[2012-02-07 23:03:16 UTC] <ashley> ok
[2012-02-07 23:03:17 UTC] <charlie> and we can always extend it in python with weird little modules
[2012-02-07 23:03:26 UTC] <charlie> i mean, we're gonna need a node.js component too
[2012-02-07 23:03:27 UTC] <ashley> totes
[2012-02-07 23:03:30 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-07 23:03:40 UTC] <charlie> for the socket server for the red buttons
[2012-02-07 23:03:45 UTC] <ashley> our gorgeous frankenstein of a web app
[2012-02-07 23:03:54 UTC] <ashley> oh my yes
[2012-02-07 23:04:07 UTC] <charlie> and we can log all those presses right to the same system
[2012-02-07 23:04:19 UTC] <charlie> oh hell, let's log on and off
[2012-02-07 23:04:19 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-07 23:05:07 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-07 23:05:08 UTC] <ashley> brb
[2012-02-07 23:50:42 UTC] <ashley> http://gyazo.com/cb3b062a35d7f71c056dad658072cb2b
[2012-02-07 23:50:46 UTC] <ashley> so i'm thinkin something like this
[2012-02-07 23:51:10 UTC] <ashley> i downloaded some -hilarious- stencil sets for omnigraffle
[2012-02-07 23:51:11 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-07 23:52:07 UTC] * ashley quit (ashley)
[2012-02-07 23:58:05 UTC] * ashley joined
[2012-02-08 00:01:06 UTC] <charlie> ga
[2012-02-08 00:01:16 UTC] <charlie> ha, you're awesome
[2012-02-08 00:01:28 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-08 00:01:39 UTC] <charlie> i like the little city just labeled "Location"
[2012-02-08 00:01:54 UTC] <ashley> oh yeah
[2012-02-08 00:02:00 UTC] <ashley> those are all just out of the box stencil labels
[2012-02-08 00:02:01 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-08 00:02:08 UTC] <charlie> breathtaking
[2012-02-08 00:03:05 UTC] <charlie> ok, man.
[2012-02-08 00:03:08 UTC] <charlie> webapps
[2012-02-08 00:03:13 UTC] <ashley> WEBAPP
[2012-02-08 00:03:14 UTC] <charlie> they do grow, don't they
[2012-02-08 00:03:25 UTC] <ashley> oh yes
[2012-02-08 00:03:30 UTC] <charlie> just all these little cases you have to accoount for
[2012-02-08 00:03:34 UTC] <charlie> that all seem to take an hour or so
[2012-02-08 00:03:38 UTC] <ashley> like kudzu
[2012-02-08 00:04:17 UTC] <ashley> i have a hard time estimating where i am in a project
[2012-02-08 00:04:24 UTC] <ashley> that's another reason i love my BEAUTIFUL IADS
[2012-02-08 00:04:31 UTC] <charlie> hahaha
[2012-02-08 00:04:42 UTC] <charlie> too stunning to gaze upon
[2012-02-08 00:04:43 UTC] <ashley> it's like, well, this will not take more than 2, MAYBE 3 hours
[2012-02-08 00:04:52 UTC] <charlie> yeah man
[2012-02-08 00:04:55 UTC] <charlie> oh!
[2012-02-08 00:05:00 UTC] <charlie> i had a little moment earlier
[2012-02-08 00:05:02 UTC] <ashley> and then i charge for 4 and we call it a day
[2012-02-08 00:05:05 UTC] <ashley> oh yeah?
[2012-02-08 00:05:11 UTC] <charlie> you know that time in a longer programming project
[2012-02-08 00:05:18 UTC] <charlie> the first time you stumble onto code you honestly don't remember writing?
[2012-02-08 00:05:25 UTC] <charlie> but you know you did
[2012-02-08 00:05:35 UTC] <ashley> HA
[2012-02-08 00:05:36 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-08 00:05:41 UTC] <charlie> it's a weird moment, ashley
[2012-02-08 00:05:42 UTC] <ashley> oh god yes
[2012-02-08 00:05:55 UTC] <ashley> i like that you recognize that
[2012-02-08 00:06:05 UTC] <charlie> it just like
[2012-02-08 00:06:12 UTC] <ashley> it's always kindof strange the first time it happens in an individual project too
[2012-02-08 00:06:12 UTC] <charlie> our sense of the present is limited!
[2012-02-08 00:06:15 UTC] <ashley> like at this point in wsj
[2012-02-08 00:06:19 UTC] <ashley> i have no idea who did anything in there
[2012-02-08 00:06:20 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-08 00:06:38 UTC] <ashley> but also like, markup is a lot less personal than code-code
[2012-02-08 00:06:46 UTC] <ashley> hmm
[2012-02-08 00:06:49 UTC] <ashley> dude yeah
[2012-02-08 00:06:53 UTC] <ashley> i was pulling up some old graffle files
[2012-02-08 00:07:00 UTC] <ashley> to see if i had anything to use as a starting point
[2012-02-08 00:07:08 UTC] <ashley> and i happened to open the db schema for kashi
[2012-02-08 00:07:13 UTC] <ashley> and it just came FLOODING back to me
[2012-02-08 00:07:17 UTC] <charlie> ha
[2012-02-08 00:07:21 UTC] <ashley> like, christ man
[2012-02-08 00:07:22 UTC] <charlie> pupils widening
[2012-02-08 00:07:29 UTC] <ashley> i had that entire app in my brain at one point
[2012-02-08 00:07:34 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-08 00:07:42 UTC] <charlie> yeah man, like
[2012-02-08 00:07:50 UTC] <charlie> you REALLY build a little version for yourself in your head
[2012-02-08 00:07:53 UTC] <ashley> the whole db schema, every weird little thing about each model
[2012-02-08 00:07:57 UTC] <ashley> :)
[2012-02-08 00:08:00 UTC] <ashley> what would you call that
[2012-02-08 00:08:01 UTC] <charlie> you're DEFINITELY like, doing some hardwiring up there
[2012-02-08 00:08:09 UTC] <ashley> it's not quite a memory palace
[2012-02-08 00:08:14 UTC] <charlie> no, man
[2012-02-08 00:08:17 UTC] <charlie> but it does feel kinda spatial
[2012-02-08 00:08:19 UTC] <ashley> but it's something
[2012-02-08 00:08:21 UTC] <charlie> oh fuck
[2012-02-08 00:08:23 UTC] <ashley> yeah for sure
[2012-02-08 00:08:24 UTC] <charlie> i wonder
[2012-02-08 00:08:33 UTC] <charlie> would it make you a better programmer to think about it spatially like that?
[2012-02-08 00:08:46 UTC] <ashley> if they've done any studies to see what parts of people's brains light up when they program?
[2012-02-08 00:08:50 UTC] <ashley> IF NOT THEY SHOULD
[2012-02-08 00:08:54 UTC] <charlie> agreed
[2012-02-08 00:09:02 UTC] <ashley> hmm
[2012-02-08 00:09:05 UTC] <charlie> man :)
[2012-02-08 00:09:11 UTC] <charlie> hi ashley
[2012-02-08 00:09:19 UTC] <ashley> charlie
[2012-02-08 00:09:23 UTC] <ashley> let's pause for a second
[2012-02-08 00:09:28 UTC] <ashley> ...
[2012-02-08 00:09:29 UTC] <ashley> ahh
[2012-02-08 00:09:59 UTC] <charlie> what're you listening to?
[2012-02-08 00:10:11 UTC] <ashley> https://www.dropbox.com/home/NPI/photographs?select=roadtrip.png#/photographs:::95019405
[2012-02-08 00:10:12 UTC] <ashley> that
[2012-02-08 00:10:15 UTC] <ashley> i'm listening to that photo
[2012-02-08 00:10:25 UTC] <ashley> i'm actually in a coffeeshop and joy division is playing
[2012-02-08 00:10:35 UTC] <ashley> but in my head i'm hearing ladybug
[2012-02-08 00:10:36 UTC] <ashley> ugh sorry
[2012-02-08 00:10:39 UTC] <ashley> i'm so gross sometimes
[2012-02-08 00:10:40 UTC] <ashley> FAG

[2012-02-08 22:18:37 UTC] <charlie> yeah dude.  i'd say that right there's our best bet
[2012-02-08 22:18:44 UTC] <charlie> in terms of like, cost:frustration ratio
[2012-02-08 22:18:55 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-08 22:18:56 UTC] <charlie> you can find cheaper, but not better documented
[2012-02-08 22:19:04 UTC] <ashley> frustration seems to ramp up pretty quickly with receipt printers
[2012-02-08 22:19:18 UTC] <charlie> Holtgraver's Principle 
[2012-02-08 22:19:29 UTC] <ashley> i remember tadge reverse engineering one in our robotic art class
[2012-02-08 22:19:37 UTC] <ashley> he naturally chose one from like, 1975
[2012-02-08 22:19:42 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-08 22:19:43 UTC] <charlie> haha

[2012-02-08 22:20:00 UTC] <ashley> we can't be getting tetanus and cobol on our hands
[2012-02-08 22:20:03 UTC] <charlie> when i'm looking at receipt printers
[2012-02-08 22:20:13 UTC] <charlie> like "oh pfft, that's a fortune!  there's probably a big pile of 'em just lying around somewhere!"
[2012-02-08 22:20:21 UTC] <ashley> LOL
[2012-02-08 22:20:26 UTC] <ashley> yep that sounds about right
[2012-02-08 22:20:27 UTC] <charlie> and you know what?
[2012-02-08 22:20:29 UTC] <charlie> there probably is.
[2012-02-08 22:20:32 UTC] <ashley> i've just been through that so many times
[2012-02-08 22:20:34 UTC] <ashley> IT'S NOT WORTH IT
[2012-02-08 22:20:36 UTC] <charlie> but luckly there's another part of me
[2012-02-08 22:20:36 UTC] <ashley> DON'T DO IT CHARLIE
[2012-02-08 22:20:43 UTC] <charlie> that knows that's a terrible idea
[2012-02-08 22:20:58 UTC] <charlie> and he's been getting... not louder over the years
[2012-02-08 22:21:12 UTC] <charlie> but like, more assured of his position, so i tend to listen to him
[2012-02-08 22:21:15 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHAHA
[2012-02-08 22:21:31 UTC] <ashley> i'm picturing it as a little collection of hamsters at a round table
[2012-02-08 22:21:35 UTC] <charlie> HA!
[2012-02-08 22:21:40 UTC] <charlie> ironically not far from the truth
[2012-02-08 22:21:41 UTC] <ashley> the sensible one has a nice red bowtie and blue seersucker suit
[2012-02-08 22:21:52 UTC] <ashley> the tadge one is dressed like tadge
[2012-02-08 22:21:58 UTC] <charlie> "Now charlie, a bird in the hand's worth two in the bush, you see"
[2012-02-08 22:22:03 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-08 22:22:21 UTC] <charlie> "But charlie!  Glayvin glarivn, just ask bodegas if they have any broken ones they're giving away!"
[2012-02-08 22:22:25 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHAHAHA

[2012-02-08 22:22:43 UTC] <ashley> right
[2012-02-08 22:22:44 UTC] <charlie> listening intently
[2012-02-08 22:22:47 UTC] <ashley> the Main Hamster Viewer
[2012-02-08 22:22:50 UTC] <ashley> MHV for short
[2012-02-08 22:22:54 UTC] <ashley> aka your cerebral cortex
[2012-02-08 22:23:00 UTC] <charlie> it's basically herman's head
[2012-02-08 22:23:04 UTC] <charlie> but like, a tiny bit funnier
[2012-02-08 22:23:05 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-08 22:23:08 UTC] <ashley> never saw it
[2012-02-08 22:23:10 UTC] <ashley> but i get the gist
[2012-02-08 22:23:12 UTC] <charlie> you didn't miss anything
[2012-02-08 22:23:49 UTC] <charlie> throw it on the tired pile labeled "fox sitcoms that briefly existed between the simpsons and the xfiles timeslots"
[2012-02-08 22:24:00 UTC] <ashley> Outline Dimension (WxDxH): 111x65x57mm
[2012-02-08 22:24:13 UTC] <charlie> w/d/h?
[2012-02-08 22:24:22 UTC] <ashley> for the receipt printer
[2012-02-08 22:24:41 UTC] <ashley> that can't be the real size
[2012-02-08 22:25:05 UTC] <ashley> where'r the dang dimensions for this thinger

[2012-02-08 22:31:14 UTC] <charlie> this irc server AND the bot
[2012-02-08 22:31:20 UTC] <charlie> are both node, and i haven't had to restart them in like, weeks

[2012-02-08 23:39:40 UTC] <charlie> man, that took a littel while longer than i wanted ti to
[2012-02-08 23:39:45 UTC] <charlie> it was like ALMOST working
[2012-02-08 23:39:54 UTC] <charlie> but this one other script i was running is a hair hacked and was complaining about some shit
[2012-02-08 23:40:00 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-08 23:40:05 UTC] <ashley> 90/10 rule?
[2012-02-08 23:40:08 UTC] <charlie> yeah basically
[2012-02-08 23:40:20 UTC] <charlie> ge needs all personal info in their db's encrypted
[2012-02-08 23:41:08 UTC] <ashley> well that's nice of them

[2012-02-08 23:41:59 UTC] <charlie> yep!
[2012-02-08 23:42:18 UTC] <charlie> hmm we need to watch some nathan barley sometime soon
[2012-02-08 23:42:28 UTC] <charlie> maybe next dvb
[2012-02-08 23:43:52 UTC] <ashley> that'd be excellent
[2012-02-08 23:43:53 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-08 23:44:39 UTC] <ashley> so if you google 'rsa securid attack' a bunch of stuff from RSA comes up - their open letter on when it happened, how much money they lost (like $11mm)
[2012-02-08 23:44:55 UTC] <ashley> but if you google 'rsa securid hack' you learn a lot more
[2012-02-08 23:44:57 UTC] <ashley> ha
[2012-02-08 23:45:12 UTC] <charlie> IT'S A SECRET TO EVERYBODY.
[2012-02-08 23:45:15 UTC] <ashley> apparently there's this nomenclature, APT - advanced persistent threat
[2012-02-08 23:45:31 UTC] <ashley> APTs represent a significant change in the security landscape. An APT attack involves patient, skilled, well-funded attackers going after the really big prize.
[2012-02-08 23:45:34 UTC] <ashley> PIRATE KINGS!
[2012-02-08 23:46:23 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-08 23:46:39 UTC] <charlie> yeah it's pretty rad like, the promise of cyberpunk is sort of coming true
[2012-02-08 23:46:46 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-08 23:46:47 UTC] <charlie> not quite the same thing
[2012-02-08 23:46:50 UTC] <charlie> but there was a vimeo video
[2012-02-08 23:46:52 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-08 23:46:58 UTC] <ashley> it's just the more realistic way
[2012-02-08 23:47:02 UTC] <charlie> behind the scenes of the studio where the occupy wall st. livestream was broadcast
[2012-02-08 23:47:18 UTC] <ashley> ooh
[2012-02-08 23:47:19 UTC] <charlie> so rad, just these little mobile rigs they'd hack togetehr
[2012-02-08 23:47:25 UTC] <ashley> that's awesome man
[2012-02-08 23:47:25 UTC] <charlie> in some closet apartment in NYC
[2012-02-08 23:47:36 UTC] <charlie> like "yep, we can broadcast global video too now."
[2012-02-08 23:47:43 UTC] <charlie> you don't need your own satellite anymore
[2012-02-08 23:48:22 UTC] <ashley> nope!
[2012-02-08 23:48:28 UTC] <ashley> just need a dang computator
[2012-02-08 23:48:38 UTC] <ashley> HA the rsa internal attack was accomplished via  bug in FLASH
[2012-02-08 23:48:43 UTC] <ashley> SUCK IT FLASH
[2012-02-08 23:48:47 UTC] <charlie> oof
[2012-02-08 23:48:55 UTC] <ashley> they sent out phishing emails witha  flash binary embedded in an xls
[2012-02-08 23:49:02 UTC] <charlie> woah
[2012-02-08 23:49:05 UTC] <charlie> gnarly
[2012-02-08 23:49:19 UTC] <ashley> and once that was opened from internal employee computers it just worked its way up
[2012-02-08 23:49:20 UTC] <ashley> you would think
[2012-02-08 23:49:26 UTC] <ashley> if you worked for a company like RSA securid
[2012-02-08 23:49:33 UTC] <charlie> oh fuck
[2012-02-08 23:49:36 UTC] <ashley> you might not open weird email xls attachments

[2012-02-09 21:41:44 UTC] <ashley> and i turned to carrie to say something

[2012-02-09 22:05:18 UTC] <charlie> it's just gangbusters
[2012-02-09 22:05:35 UTC] <charlie> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_days_of_the_week
[2012-02-09 22:06:08 UTC] <charlie> woah!
[2012-02-09 22:06:12 UTC] <charlie> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar#Nundinal_cycle
[2012-02-09 22:06:29 UTC] <charlie> 8 day weeks!
[2012-02-09 22:06:58 UTC] <charlie> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#.22Weeks.22_in_other_calendars
[2012-02-09 22:07:31 UTC] <charlie> The Javanese people of Indonesia have a five-day week known as the Pasaran cycle. This is still in use today and superimposed with seven-day week of the Gregorian calendar and Islamic calendar to become what is known as the 35-day Wetonan Cycle.
[2012-02-09 22:07:55 UTC] <ashley> WOAH
[2012-02-09 22:07:59 UTC] <ashley> omg that's awesome

[2012-02-09 22:08:07 UTC] <ashley> PEOPLE
[2012-02-09 22:08:09 UTC] <ashley> hahahahaha
[2012-02-09 22:08:12 UTC] <ashley> YAY
[2012-02-09 22:08:16 UTC] <charlie> think of how weird it'd be to have 5 day weeks
[2012-02-09 22:08:18 UTC] <charlie> like
[2012-02-09 22:08:20 UTC] <ashley> i never researched it before!
[2012-02-09 22:08:25 UTC] <charlie> all of life would just feel a little... faster paced
[2012-02-09 22:08:40 UTC] <charlie> 73 weeks per year instead of 52
[2012-02-09 22:08:46 UTC] <ashley> but also maybe more spread out
[2012-02-09 22:08:46 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-09 22:08:59 UTC] <ashley> like next thursday feels close
[2012-02-09 22:09:01 UTC] <charlie> i mean, it's funny 
[2012-02-09 22:09:03 UTC] <ashley> because it's a week or less away
[2012-02-09 22:09:05 UTC] <charlie> there's a part in Connections
[2012-02-09 22:09:10 UTC] <ashley> AHHH I LOVE CONNECTIONS
[2012-02-09 22:09:12 UTC] <charlie> i forget the line
[2012-02-09 22:09:13 UTC] <ashley> WE NEED TO WATCH THAT
[2012-02-09 22:09:15 UTC] <charlie> but it's something like
[2012-02-09 22:09:39 UTC] <charlie> the rhythm of breakfast and the daily highway commute is as much a part of the assembly line process as the conveyor belt that carries the parts
[2012-02-09 22:09:43 UTC] <charlie> or something like that
[2012-02-09 22:10:00 UTC] <charlie> like a whole nation full of people get up and eat and move to a place to do work all together everyday, more or less
[2012-02-09 22:10:27 UTC] <ashley> dude
[2012-02-09 22:10:28 UTC] <charlie> and it's just an evolution from the way business started getting done 
[2012-02-09 22:10:31 UTC] <ashley> i was just thinking about that this morning
[2012-02-09 22:10:44 UTC] <ashley> like how my day has this lack of process now, and how that makes my brain feel a little different than it used to
[2012-02-09 22:11:01 UTC] <ashley> i was thinking this as i was eating breakfast nude while reading my kindle
[2012-02-09 22:11:03 UTC] <ashley> haahaha

[2012-02-09 22:13:42 UTC] <charlie> yeah dude
[2012-02-09 22:13:53 UTC] <charlie> ashley fuckin' holtgraver
[2012-02-09 22:14:00 UTC] <charlie> who'd a thunk it?
[2012-02-09 22:14:01 UTC] <ashley> oh dude i clinked that click you had in jerktar
[2012-02-09 22:14:07 UTC] <charlie> clinked
[2012-02-09 22:14:20 UTC] <ashley> itw as like, some british dude talking excitedly about how lifespans have gone steadily up over the years
[2012-02-09 22:14:31 UTC] <charlie> yep! he's way into it
[2012-02-09 22:14:37 UTC] <ashley> but i wonder if there's any correlation between quality of life and having a modern schedule
[2012-02-09 22:14:42 UTC] <ashley> where do the 3 meals come from?
[2012-02-09 22:14:49 UTC] <charlie> ha, good question
[2012-02-09 22:14:53 UTC] <ashley> who the fuck thought of that
[2012-02-09 22:14:54 UTC] <charlie> i bet that goes pretty far back
[2012-02-09 22:14:55 UTC] <ashley> 3 meals a day
[2012-02-09 22:15:07 UTC] <charlie> that feels... somewhat natural
[2012-02-09 22:15:07 UTC] <charlie> i mean
[2012-02-09 22:15:12 UTC] <charlie> it tends to be like
[2012-02-09 22:15:14 UTC] <charlie> you eat when you're hungry
[2012-02-09 22:15:19 UTC] <charlie> and you're hungry around 3 times a day
[2012-02-09 22:15:29 UTC] <charlie> but, yeah, it's DEFINITELY a balance
[2012-02-09 22:15:41 UTC] <charlie> of natural inclination and societal influence informing each other
[2012-02-09 22:15:58 UTC] <charlie> and laying track in a particular pattern that fits most easily within the constraints of both systems
[2012-02-09 22:17:12 UTC] <ashley> yeah, but there are tribes that just munch all day
[2012-02-09 22:17:23 UTC] <ashley> and that's the healthier / more natural thing for your metabolism
[2012-02-09 22:17:27 UTC] <ashley> just constantly eat all the livelong day
[2012-02-09 22:17:44 UTC] <charlie> woah
[2012-02-09 22:17:53 UTC] <charlie> in bali: The Pawukon is a 210-day calendar consisting of 10 different concurrent weeks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 days.

[2012-02-10 00:18:35 UTC] <charlie> and suddenly there's money involved
[2012-02-10 00:18:36 UTC] <ashley> with brief, blinding moments of climax, due to adreneline or orgasms or drugs
[2012-02-10 00:18:46 UTC] <charlie> and you turn on your friends over the course of a few drug-addled years
[2012-02-10 00:19:01 UTC] <ashley> i keep meaning to watch the metallica documentary
[2012-02-10 00:19:03 UTC] <charlie> and then drift into the oblivion of the late 70s and early 80s

[2012-02-10 00:19:22 UTC] <ashley> just horrible
[2012-02-10 00:19:23 UTC] <charlie> and then do a reunion tour, tired and declawed in the early 90s to gentle fanfare and mixed reviews

[2012-02-10 18:21:05 UTC] <ashley> the little account that could
[2012-02-10 18:21:10 UTC] <charlie> dude, this thing's amazing
[2012-02-10 18:21:15 UTC] <charlie> cron jobs, daemon processes
[2012-02-10 18:21:23 UTC] <charlie> dude, i even get root access
[2012-02-10 18:21:27 UTC] <charlie> for $5/mo
[2012-02-10 18:22:27 UTC] <ashley> yeah dude
[2012-02-10 18:22:31 UTC] <charlie> anyways, so when you log in
[2012-02-10 18:22:35 UTC] <ashley> heh yes
[2012-02-10 18:22:36 UTC] <charlie> there's a symlink to an npi folder
[2012-02-10 18:22:43 UTC] <ashley> sorry, i'm distracted today, wsj is all blowin up
[2012-02-10 18:22:48 UTC] <charlie> oh np
[2012-02-10 18:23:07 UTC] <ashley> but
[2012-02-10 18:23:10 UTC] <charlie> long story short, i copied everything to npi, but i'm not running anything from there yet
[2012-02-10 18:23:17 UTC] <charlie> but we both have perms so go nuts
[2012-02-10 18:23:18 UTC] <ashley> so symlink in my homedir to npi?
[2012-02-10 18:23:22 UTC] <ashley> !!
[2012-02-10 18:23:23 UTC] <ashley> WOO
[2012-02-10 18:23:36 UTC] <charlie> and we'll figure out some deployment strategy later
[2012-02-10 18:23:39 UTC] <charlie> we should probably like
[2012-02-10 18:23:52 UTC] <ashley> yeah for sure
[2012-02-10 18:23:57 UTC] <charlie> do this shit right, with a production area and a dev area, maybe our own branches for features and shit
[2012-02-10 18:23:58 UTC] <ashley> ugh deployment strategies always give me headaches
[2012-02-10 18:24:03 UTC] <ashley> but yeah
[2012-02-10 18:24:08 UTC] <ashley> i mean, if we can't do it right on NPI
[2012-02-10 18:24:10 UTC] <ashley> there's just no hope
[2012-02-10 18:24:16 UTC] <charlie> i know, i want to get good enough at them that i don't get headaches
[2012-02-10 18:24:20 UTC] <charlie> i'm realizing like
[2012-02-10 18:24:32 UTC] <charlie> i want a 6 month scripting sabbatical 
[2012-02-10 18:24:32 UTC] <ashley> ADVIL UP
[2012-02-10 18:24:36 UTC] <ashley> hahahahahaha
[2012-02-10 18:24:39 UTC] <ashley> as in
[2012-02-10 18:24:42 UTC] <charlie> i want 6 months to just really take a look at what i do all day
[2012-02-10 18:24:42 UTC] <ashley> you do nothing but script?
[2012-02-10 18:24:47 UTC] <ashley> or you don't script a godamned thing?
[2012-02-10 18:24:48 UTC] <charlie> and find common patterns
[2012-02-10 18:24:51 UTC] <ashley> ahhhhh
[2012-02-10 18:24:58 UTC] <charlie> and make some dotfiles that streamline the shit out of it
[2012-02-10 18:25:02 UTC] <charlie> and also like, git school
[2012-02-10 18:25:08 UTC] <charlie> and software deployment school
[2012-02-10 18:25:28 UTC] <charlie> i feel really halfbaked on that shit, and like i have to just figure it out all over again every project
[2012-02-10 18:25:46 UTC] <charlie> and i definitely like, use git in the most rudimentary fucking way possible
[2012-02-10 18:25:55 UTC] <charlie> anyhow, that'd be nice.
[2012-02-10 18:26:31 UTC] <ashley> ugh well deployment i'm convinced is like that
[2012-02-10 18:26:41 UTC] <ashley> every 6 months someone has a solution that "actually works"
[2012-02-10 18:26:50 UTC] <ashley> and it's always like super framework specific
[2012-02-10 18:26:51 UTC] <ashley> i dunno
[2012-02-10 18:27:08 UTC] <ashley> deployment recipes make me feel bad inside!!
[2012-02-10 18:27:14 UTC] <ashley> i just want to hire someone to do that for me!
[2012-02-10 18:27:15 UTC] <ashley> NOT MY JOB!

[2012-02-10 22:08:21 UTC] <charlie> a topic hotly debated among historians 
[2012-02-10 22:08:35 UTC] <charlie> hotly
[2012-02-10 22:08:36 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-10 22:08:51 UTC] <charlie> i guess that begs the question
[2012-02-10 22:08:58 UTC] <charlie> did we invent or discover no pants island
[2012-02-10 22:09:07 UTC] <charlie> if we discovered it
[2012-02-10 22:09:08 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-10 22:09:10 UTC] <charlie> then yes, they were npi
[2012-02-10 22:09:12 UTC] <ashley> like the internet!
[2012-02-10 22:09:14 UTC] <ashley> nobody knows!
[2012-02-10 22:09:16 UTC] <charlie> we just didn't know it yet
[2012-02-10 22:09:18 UTC] <charlie> but!
[2012-02-10 22:09:22 UTC] <charlie> if instead we invented npi
[2012-02-10 22:09:34 UTC] <charlie> then maybe we should begin numbering where we started calling it that
[2012-02-10 22:09:49 UTC] <charlie> but yeah i think boston was NPI
[2012-02-10 22:09:52 UTC] <ashley> heh
[2012-02-10 22:09:52 UTC] <charlie> over xmas

[2012-02-10 22:12:05 UTC] <ashley> i kindof want to get like, a HUGE whiteboard for the new place
[2012-02-10 22:12:12 UTC] <charlie> that thing was a real layabout
[2012-02-10 22:12:14 UTC] <ashley> or something along those lines
[2012-02-10 22:12:20 UTC] <charlie> yeah i love whiteboards
[2012-02-10 22:12:37 UTC] <charlie> idea!
[2012-02-10 22:12:42 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-10 22:12:45 UTC] <charlie> get a whiteboard
[2012-02-10 22:12:45 UTC] <ashley> whiteboard videocamera?
[2012-02-10 22:12:47 UTC] <charlie> ugh
[2012-02-10 22:12:48 UTC] <charlie> yes.
[2012-02-10 22:12:48 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-10 22:12:49 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHAHA
[2012-02-10 22:12:50 UTC] <ashley> LOL
[2012-02-10 22:12:55 UTC] <ashley> i was just thinking that
[2012-02-10 22:12:57 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-10 22:12:58 UTC] <charlie> but!
[2012-02-10 22:13:00 UTC] <charlie> you could have it just watch it
[2012-02-10 22:13:02 UTC] <charlie> and detect changes 
[2012-02-10 22:13:03 UTC] <ashley> like 1995 logitech webcam
[2012-02-10 22:13:05 UTC] <charlie> and when it's been modified
[2012-02-10 22:13:09 UTC] <charlie> take a pic and save it
[2012-02-10 22:13:10 UTC] <ashley> have it just pointing and broadcasting 24/7
[2012-02-10 22:13:16 UTC] <ashley> oh that'd be nice
[2012-02-10 22:13:18 UTC] <charlie> and then you could animate it, or scroll back
[2012-02-10 22:13:19 UTC] <ashley> slightly less wasteful
[2012-02-10 22:13:24 UTC] <charlie> to any previous whiteboard iteration
[2012-02-10 22:13:31 UTC] <charlie> i mean, hell
[2012-02-10 22:13:37 UTC] <charlie> you could easily like, have it just note when you start writing
[2012-02-10 22:13:40 UTC] <charlie> and stop
[2012-02-10 22:13:45 UTC] <charlie> and save it as an entity
[2012-02-10 22:13:55 UTC] <ashley> although it means it'd take a lot of photos when like, people were in front of it
[2012-02-10 22:14:00 UTC] <charlie> then you could make a timelapse of like, the whole history of it
[2012-02-10 22:14:08 UTC] <charlie> i bet you could make it smarter than that
[2012-02-10 22:14:16 UTC] <charlie> oh !
[2012-02-10 22:14:19 UTC] <charlie> here
[2012-02-10 22:14:23 UTC] <charlie> you have a band along the bottom of it
[2012-02-10 22:14:28 UTC] <charlie> like, black and white striped
[2012-02-10 22:14:31 UTC] <charlie> something recognizable
[2012-02-10 22:14:38 UTC] <charlie> and it won't take a picture unless it can see that whole band
[2012-02-10 22:14:52 UTC] <charlie> so, if someone's writing, it ignores that frame
[2012-02-10 22:15:50 UTC] <ashley> oh that's smart!
[2012-02-10 22:15:52 UTC] <ashley> you smartypants
[2012-02-10 22:15:56 UTC] <ashley> hm what's the easiest way to do this
[2012-02-10 22:16:03 UTC] <ashley> like a localhost ruby thing with imagemagick?
[2012-02-10 22:16:06 UTC] <ashley> nah
[2012-02-10 22:16:07 UTC] <charlie> :)

[2012-02-13 08:11:05 UTC] <ashley> (i love this song)
[2012-02-13 08:11:11 UTC] <ashley> i never totally understood that phrase
[2012-02-13 08:11:27 UTC] <ashley> is it like - humility?
[2012-02-13 08:11:31 UTC] <charlie> well
[2012-02-13 08:11:34 UTC] <ashley> like we're just fuckin lucky to be alive?
[2012-02-13 08:11:34 UTC] <charlie> it's sort of like
[2012-02-13 08:12:01 UTC] <charlie> the idea is you see something you feel like you could have fallen into but didn't
[2012-02-13 08:12:12 UTC] <charlie> but that's not quite iet
[2012-02-13 08:12:13 UTC] <charlie> *it
[2012-02-13 08:12:31 UTC] <ashley> ahhhhh
[2012-02-13 08:12:43 UTC] <charlie> but i mean it mostly jokingly
[2012-02-13 08:12:48 UTC] <ashley> oh sure
[2012-02-13 08:12:51 UTC] <ashley> well i know what you mean though
[2012-02-13 08:12:54 UTC] <ashley> like
[2012-02-13 08:13:00 UTC] <ashley> i'm very happy with who i am
[2012-02-13 08:13:11 UTC] <ashley> but if i had been mushed in a different way when i was a kid 
[2012-02-13 08:13:12 UTC] <charlie> you oughta be, i mean, you totally rock
[2012-02-13 08:13:17 UTC] <ashley> things coulda been different.
[2012-02-13 08:13:19 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-13 08:13:25 UTC] <charlie> yeah i think about that a lot
[2012-02-13 08:13:28 UTC] <ashley> it's weird, my friend amy is like, this weird living example of that
[2012-02-13 08:13:39 UTC] <charlie> like, if i'd been not quite treated as well as i was
[2012-02-13 08:13:46 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-13 08:13:52 UTC] <charlie> or for whatever reason not quite as popular early on, i mean
[2012-02-13 08:14:06 UTC] <charlie> i'm happy with who i am too
[2012-02-13 08:14:09 UTC] <charlie> i haven't always been
[2012-02-13 08:14:14 UTC] <charlie> but i mean, looking back on it
[2012-02-13 08:14:22 UTC] <charlie> like, i had zero excuse to not be pretty awesome
[2012-02-13 08:14:30 UTC] <ashley> :)
[2012-02-13 08:14:44 UTC] <charlie> i got and continue to get real lucky
[2012-02-13 08:14:51 UTC] <ashley> yeah but also like - the world can just be hard on some people
[2012-02-13 08:15:03 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-13 08:15:05 UTC] <ashley> and it's like - we both had a lot of advantages, i'm sure
[2012-02-13 08:15:26 UTC] <ashley> but it's not like we're totally without any suffering or adversity
[2012-02-13 08:15:31 UTC] <ashley> you want -some- of that
[2012-02-13 08:15:39 UTC] <ashley> BUILDS CHARACTER
[2012-02-13 08:15:43 UTC] <charlie> yeah you need some
[2012-02-13 08:15:59 UTC] <charlie> it pushes you around and gives you perspective
[2012-02-13 08:16:12 UTC] <ashley> i feel like i've sometimes invented adversity for myself
[2012-02-13 08:16:35 UTC] <ashley> or i guess the biggest adversity i really had growing up was the parental pressure
[2012-02-13 08:16:53 UTC] <ashley> if it's not one thing it's another!
[2012-02-13 08:17:00 UTC] <charlie> ah jeez, again with the pressure
[2012-02-13 08:17:03 UTC] <ashley> hahaha

[2012-02-13 20:11:17 UTC] <ashley> dealing with transferring internet and electricity does that
[2012-02-13 20:11:20 UTC] <charlie> and so i got real cosy
[2012-02-13 20:11:21 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHA
[2012-02-13 20:11:24 UTC] <charlie> and got my space heater
[2012-02-13 20:11:33 UTC] <charlie> and aimed it at my feet, put my programming hat on
[2012-02-13 20:11:37 UTC] <charlie> and low and be-fucking-hold
[2012-02-13 20:11:38 UTC] <ashley> YEAH!
[2012-02-13 20:11:42 UTC] <charlie> i keep blowing fuses at the office

[2012-02-13 20:12:06 UTC] <charlie> making a big stink about it
[2012-02-13 20:12:14 UTC] <charlie> so claude invited me to sit at zoe's desk since she's out
[2012-02-13 20:12:17 UTC] <charlie> and share her space heater
[2012-02-13 20:12:29 UTC] <ashley> awww
[2012-02-13 20:12:32 UTC] <charlie> but zoe's desk has this solar powered owl

[2012-02-13 20:12:43 UTC] <ashley> HA i know that fucker!!!!
[2012-02-13 20:12:49 UTC] <ashley> there was one at the boston office
[2012-02-13 20:12:56 UTC] <ashley> i used to put a paper bag over it
[2012-02-13 20:13:00 UTC] <charlie> it's just in my peripheral vision
[2012-02-13 20:13:00 UTC] <charlie> a
[2012-02-13 20:13:02 UTC] <charlie> and i look over
[2012-02-13 20:13:03 UTC] <charlie> and it's like
[2012-02-13 20:13:04 UTC] <ashley> or itw asn't an owl, it was some amorphous droplet man
[2012-02-13 20:13:09 UTC] <charlie> "who the fuck do you think you are?"
[2012-02-13 20:13:15 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHAHA
[2012-02-13 20:13:20 UTC] <charlie> "what exactly is it you disapprove of?"
[2012-02-13 20:13:25 UTC] <ashley> 'I DIDN'T BLOW A FUUUUUUSE EVERRRRRRR'
[2012-02-13 20:13:27 UTC] <charlie> "will you EVER be happy?"
[2012-02-13 20:13:32 UTC] <ashley> he hates all the amperes you use
[2012-02-13 20:13:33 UTC] <ashley> you DICK
[2012-02-13 20:13:39 UTC] <ashley> you friendly dick
[2012-02-13 20:13:47 UTC] <charlie> clarence pfeffer me
[2012-02-13 20:13:47 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-13 20:13:48 UTC] <clarence> "A lot of butthole savagery" #TBGX
[2012-02-13 20:13:50 UTC] <ashley> man see
[2012-02-13 20:13:56 UTC] <ashley> the new one will choose randomly
[2012-02-13 20:13:58 UTC] <ashley> lemme put that in there
[2012-02-13 20:14:00 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-13 20:14:01 UTC] <charlie> ok so
[2012-02-13 20:14:01 UTC] <ashley> and you can bounce the process
[2012-02-13 20:14:04 UTC] <ashley> so
[2012-02-13 20:14:04 UTC] <ashley> hahaa
[2012-02-13 20:14:05 UTC] <charlie> slightly new directory structure
[2012-02-13 20:14:12 UTC] <ashley> oh boy
[2012-02-13 20:14:16 UTC] <charlie> whoops
[2012-02-13 20:14:19 UTC] <charlie> it thought i was sending a command
[2012-02-13 20:14:25 UTC] <charlie> it is: npi/irc/clarence
[2012-02-13 20:14:30 UTC] <charlie> not the hubot folder
[2012-02-13 20:14:41 UTC] <charlie> apparently you're supposed to like, "deploy" bots out of the source dir
[2012-02-13 20:14:43 UTC] <ashley> how do you send the password in the ssh command?
[2012-02-13 20:14:47 UTC] <ashley> it's some insane letter
[2012-02-13 20:14:56 UTC] <charlie> oh you just need to copy your pub key over
[2012-02-13 20:15:02 UTC] <charlie> then you'll be cookin' with gas
[2012-02-13 20:15:02 UTC] <ashley> oooh i need to do that do i
[2012-02-13 20:15:12 UTC] <charlie> i don't have to type in anything
[2012-02-13 20:15:17 UTC] <charlie> just ssh charliehoey@npi.flimshaw.net
[2012-02-13 20:15:18 UTC] <charlie> and boom
[2012-02-13 20:15:22 UTC] <charlie> as if my magic
[2012-02-13 20:15:28 UTC] <charlie> my keyboard is connected to a computer far, far away
[2012-02-13 20:15:30 UTC] <charlie> that i will never see
[2012-02-13 20:16:08 UTC] <ashley> wait
[2012-02-13 20:16:09 UTC] <ashley> i'm so lost
[2012-02-13 20:16:12 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-13 20:16:16 UTC] <charlie> follow me
[2012-02-13 20:16:17 UTC] <charlie> to victory
[2012-02-13 20:16:24 UTC] <ashley> can you send me the absolute path?
[2012-02-13 20:16:26 UTC] <charlie> so, on your laptop
[2012-02-13 20:16:28 UTC] <charlie> oh yes
[2012-02-13 20:16:30 UTC] <ashley> on flimshaw
[2012-02-13 20:16:54 UTC] <ashley> and YES please let me follow you to victory
[2012-02-13 20:16:57 UTC] <ashley> please charlie
[2012-02-13 20:17:04 UTC] <ashley> teach me the ways of ssh pub keys
[2012-02-13 20:17:09 UTC] <ashley> i never actually like, understood them
[2012-02-13 20:17:10 UTC] <charlie> : /home/npi/dev/irc/clarence
[2012-02-13 20:17:16 UTC] <ashley> AH in dev
[2012-02-13 20:17:17 UTC] <ashley> thanks!
[2012-02-13 20:17:32 UTC] <charlie> so, you've got a ssh pub key probably
[2012-02-13 20:17:42 UTC] <charlie> man, yeah learning about pub key encryption
[2012-02-13 20:17:49 UTC] <charlie> was like, a really nice couple weeks of my life
[2012-02-13 20:18:07 UTC] <charlie> of reading about it and being like "nope!  no understanding yet.  I'll try tomorrow."
[2012-02-13 20:18:23 UTC] <charlie> "nope!  still nothing.  i'll go for a walk."
[2012-02-13 20:18:32 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-13 20:18:37 UTC] <charlie> until eventually it's like "OHHHhhhhhhh"
[2012-02-13 20:18:52 UTC] <charlie> it seems not real well explained
[2012-02-13 20:19:00 UTC] <ashley> i feel like my brain learning pathways are just a little more brittle than they used to be
[2012-02-13 20:19:10 UTC] <charlie> so, where should i start
[2012-02-13 20:19:13 UTC] <ashley> hm
[2012-02-13 20:19:15 UTC] <ashley> so
[2012-02-13 20:19:26 UTC] <ashley> maybe we should do this via video or in person later
[2012-02-13 20:19:30 UTC] <charlie> yeah fair enough
[2012-02-13 20:19:34 UTC] <ashley> it seems like the type of thing i'd do better with a little diagram
[2012-02-13 20:19:52 UTC] <charlie> the basic metaphor for pgp that i like is
[2012-02-13 20:19:57 UTC] <charlie> imagine a safe with two keys
[2012-02-13 20:20:09 UTC] <ashley> i'm imagining it
[2012-02-13 20:20:09 UTC] <charlie> one key you give to everybody, but they can only put things into the safe
[2012-02-13 20:20:12 UTC] <ashley> in my mind's eye
[2012-02-13 20:20:21 UTC] <charlie> and another key you keep yourself that lets you open the safe and take things out
[2012-02-13 20:20:32 UTC] <ashley> OH
[2012-02-13 20:20:39 UTC] <ashley> dude why has noone ever just SAID that to me before
[2012-02-13 20:20:43 UTC] <ashley> in passing, on the street perhaps
[2012-02-13 20:20:44 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-13 20:20:46 UTC] <charlie> i know!!
[2012-02-13 20:20:48 UTC] <charlie> it'sl ike 
[2012-02-13 20:20:49 UTC] <charlie> oh duh
[2012-02-13 20:20:50 UTC] <charlie> thanks
[2012-02-13 20:21:00 UTC] <ashley> mind if i tumble that?
[2012-02-13 20:21:06 UTC] <charlie> tumble away chum
[2012-02-13 20:21:17 UTC] <charlie> but yeah so once you have a pub key
[2012-02-13 20:21:24 UTC] <charlie> you can encrypt shit that ONLY the person with the secret key can get
[2012-02-13 20:21:30 UTC] <charlie> including you, you can't decrypt it either
[2012-02-13 20:21:51 UTC] <charlie> so, when you generate a keypair, you get a secret one, and a public one, you copy the public one to a list of authorized keys on the server
[2012-02-13 20:22:14 UTC] <charlie> and when you log in, it encrypts a message for you and sees if you can decode it
[2012-02-13 20:22:23 UTC] <charlie> and if you can, you must be who you said you are, so it lets you in no questions asked
[2012-02-13 20:24:09 UTC] <ashley> that makes so much sense
[2012-02-13 20:24:33 UTC] <charlie> yep.  it's like
[2012-02-13 20:24:35 UTC] <ashley> and that's basically how your charliebit proxy sticks are gonna work?
[2012-02-13 20:24:42 UTC] <charlie> the only thing that keeps the earth turning at this point
[2012-02-13 20:24:45 UTC] <ashley> just blasting encrypted messages all over the dang place
[2012-02-13 20:24:46 UTC] <ashley> hahaaha
[2012-02-13 20:24:52 UTC] <charlie> hah, yep that's the idea
[2012-02-13 20:24:55 UTC] <ashley> ok
[2012-02-13 20:24:59 UTC] <charlie> you'll have raelly strong publciic key encryption
[2012-02-13 20:25:01 UTC] <ashley> so in regards to applying this concept to ssh
[2012-02-13 20:25:06 UTC] <charlie> so, doesn't matter that everybody can see every message
[2012-02-13 20:25:10 UTC] <charlie> only the recipient can read it
[2012-02-13 20:25:13 UTC] <ashley> right
[2012-02-13 20:25:22 UTC] <charlie> ok so ssh
[2012-02-13 20:25:37 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-13 20:25:38 UTC] <charlie> so
[2012-02-13 20:25:39 UTC] <ashley> sorry one sec
[2012-02-13 20:25:41 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-13 20:25:43 UTC] <ashley> JULIE KRISTINE NEEDS ME
[2012-02-13 20:26:22 UTC] <ashley> http://gyazo.com/50d147be4dc9edee7d066708c42d26c2
[2012-02-13 20:27:21 UTC] <charlie> "i value it too"
[2012-02-13 20:27:34 UTC] <charlie> i also got a call to renew my planetary society membership
[2012-02-13 20:27:37 UTC] <ashley> ooh
[2012-02-13 20:27:44 UTC] <charlie> which i really should do
[2012-02-13 20:27:57 UTC] <charlie> but ehhhh
[2012-02-13 20:28:02 UTC] <charlie> not yet
[2012-02-13 20:30:07 UTC] <ashley> man for being an internet company comcast is just NOT on their shit
[2012-02-13 20:31:03 UTC] <charlie> mitch is pretty good at 8bit synths dude
[2012-02-13 20:31:13 UTC] <charlie> he's been sending me sid chip demos
[2012-02-13 20:31:19 UTC] <charlie> they're all crunchy and awesome
[2012-02-13 20:31:28 UTC] <ashley> mmmmm
[2012-02-13 20:31:28 UTC] <ashley> man
[2012-02-13 20:31:31 UTC] <ashley> MAN
[2012-02-13 20:31:33 UTC] <ashley> MORE PROJECTS
[2012-02-13 20:31:44 UTC] <charlie> http://mitcheaton1.com/sid.mp3
[2012-02-13 20:31:49 UTC] <ashley> charlie it's just frickin impossible
[2012-02-13 20:31:54 UTC] <charlie> what is
[2012-02-13 20:32:01 UTC] <charlie> what is ashley
[2012-02-13 20:32:05 UTC] <ashley> i'm reaching kindof a critical mass for # of projects open at a given moment i think
[2012-02-13 20:32:10 UTC] <charlie> ha!
[2012-02-13 20:32:11 UTC] <charlie> oh man
[2012-02-13 20:32:13 UTC] <charlie> i'm WAY past mine
[2012-02-13 20:32:30 UTC] <charlie> i feel like i've been accruing projects on the katamari that is my life for the past ten years
[2012-02-13 20:32:46 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-13 20:32:47 UTC] <charlie> i think creative people all must share that moment
[2012-02-13 20:32:57 UTC] <ashley> well i guess it's like, open and active projects
[2012-02-13 20:32:58 UTC] <charlie> where they look at the projects they have backburnered
[2012-02-13 20:33:06 UTC] <charlie> and realize that they will not have enough time on earth to do all of it
[2012-02-13 20:33:12 UTC] <ashley> i'm not even counting all the shit i'm "working on" but that hasn't been touched except mentally in say, 2 months
[2012-02-13 20:33:21 UTC] <ashley> it's SO FRUSTRATING
[2012-02-13 20:33:33 UTC] <ashley> well i think i'm just also in a moment of Moving Stress
[2012-02-13 20:33:36 UTC] <ashley> which is a normal human thing
[2012-02-13 20:33:39 UTC] <ashley> SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME
[2012-02-13 20:33:42 UTC] <ashley> MAN HAS STRESSED OUT ABOUT MOVING
[2012-02-13 20:33:42 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-13 20:33:46 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-13 20:33:54 UTC] <charlie> except nomads
[2012-02-13 20:33:56 UTC] <charlie> they love it!
[2012-02-13 20:34:02 UTC] <ashley> UGH THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO BE!
[2012-02-13 20:34:07 UTC] <ashley> THEY DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD THEY HAVE IT!
[2012-02-13 20:34:10 UTC] <ashley> ok sorry </caps>
[2012-02-13 20:34:35 UTC] <charlie> i think the nomad life is possible
[2012-02-13 20:34:38 UTC] <charlie> but you have to get rid of a lot of possessions
[2012-02-13 20:34:52 UTC] <charlie> i've been thinking about it, i'm still actively resisting posession build up
[2012-02-13 20:35:06 UTC] <charlie> but i mean, really it's too late, i've already got like, three computers, soon a projector, some books, a car and tools for it
[2012-02-13 20:35:19 UTC] <charlie> god willing, a receiver with a phono input soon
[2012-02-13 20:35:26 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-13 20:35:26 UTC] <charlie> and then i'm gonna need records
[2012-02-13 20:35:30 UTC] <ashley> and a record player!!
[2012-02-13 20:35:34 UTC] <ashley> obvs
[2012-02-13 20:35:36 UTC] <charlie> obvs
[2012-02-13 20:35:44 UTC] <ashley> :)
[2012-02-13 20:36:01 UTC] <ashley> sorry one sec - now i'm being IM'd by my tumblr freelance client guy
[2012-02-13 20:36:02 UTC] <charlie> it's funny that there's a hard drive somewhere writing all this down
[2012-02-13 20:36:03 UTC] <ashley> which is GREAT
[2012-02-13 20:36:11 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-13 20:36:12 UTC] <ashley> i love that
[2012-02-13 20:36:14 UTC] <charlie> think of all the hard drives on earth writing things down
[2012-02-13 20:36:16 UTC] <ashley> that's the essence of clarence to me
[2012-02-13 20:36:24 UTC] <charlie> gagagagaga
[2012-02-13 20:36:25 UTC] <charlie> actually
[2012-02-13 20:36:26 UTC] <charlie> don't
[2012-02-13 20:36:30 UTC] <charlie> don't think about that.
[2012-02-13 20:37:00 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-13 20:37:04 UTC] <ashley> Hard Drive Stress
[2012-02-13 20:37:22 UTC] <ashley> a more ethereal and pervasive, less directed feeling than Moving Stress
[2012-02-13 20:39:35 UTC] <ashley> think about the huge data centers man
[2012-02-13 20:40:07 UTC] <ashley> i had a dream last year where it was the super duper future and i was touring this historical reenactment of a data center from 1995
[2012-02-13 20:40:25 UTC] <ashley> and the guide was like, naturally, we now know that all the data in this datacenter can be stored on a single human hair!
[2012-02-13 20:40:36 UTC] <ashley> which is based on this like…super old school little funny data trick
[2012-02-13 20:40:47 UTC] <ashley> gah one sec
[2012-02-13 20:40:52 UTC] <charlie> <3
[2012-02-13 20:41:49 UTC] <ashley> i am gonna redrum this tumblr dick
[2012-02-13 20:54:12 UTC] <ashley> ha
[2012-02-13 20:54:52 UTC] <ashley> ok so the idea is - you encode ALL THE DATA as ascii (or a more compressed version of ascii) - then you concat all those numbers and put a decimal point in front of it
[2012-02-13 20:54:55 UTC] <ashley> so it becomes a fraction
[2012-02-13 20:55:19 UTC] <ashley> and then in the future they had just these insanely precise lasers that would EXACTLY DIVIDE a human hair by that fraction
[2012-02-13 20:55:48 UTC] <ashley> so people had these little memory sticks that had their super precise laser etching for all human memory period
[2012-02-13 20:55:53 UTC] <ashley> and there were super precise readers too
[2012-02-13 20:55:55 UTC] <ashley> anyway
[2012-02-13 20:56:13 UTC] <ashley> probably not quite as awesome as harddrives
[2012-02-13 20:56:43 UTC] <ashley> THE FUTURE IS LASERS!
[2012-02-13 20:57:26 UTC] <charlie> huh
[2012-02-13 20:57:42 UTC] <charlie> wait
[2012-02-13 20:57:43 UTC] <charlie> woah.
[2012-02-13 20:57:59 UTC] <charlie> i see what you're saying.
[2012-02-13 20:58:01 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-13 20:58:02 UTC] <ashley> yeah man
[2012-02-13 20:58:04 UTC] <ashley> lasers.
[2012-02-13 20:58:06 UTC] <charlie> fuck
[2012-02-13 20:58:08 UTC] <charlie> you'd need like
[2012-02-13 20:58:13 UTC] <charlie> INSANE precision
[2012-02-13 20:58:22 UTC] <charlie> i mean, essentially impossible
[2012-02-13 20:58:27 UTC] <charlie> billions of decimal places
[2012-02-13 20:58:30 UTC] <charlie> zillions!

[2012-02-14 01:32:42 UTC] <charlie> it's an ok thing to do briefly
[2012-02-14 01:32:48 UTC] <charlie> but more than that
[2012-02-14 01:32:48 UTC] <charlie> come on
[2012-02-14 01:32:50 UTC] <ashley> it's one of the few things i'm like, mildly judgmental about
[2012-02-14 01:32:57 UTC] <ashley> for reasons i realize are arbitrary and personal
[2012-02-14 01:33:04 UTC] <ashley> but yeah exactly
[2012-02-14 01:33:06 UTC] <charlie> eh, you don't need personal reasons to hate it though

[2012-02-14 01:33:18 UTC] <ashley> well, i actually love the smell of cigarette smoke
[2012-02-14 01:33:20 UTC] <ashley> to my own chagrin

[2012-02-14 01:33:39 UTC] <charlie> hah
[2012-02-14 01:33:49 UTC] <ashley> and it's a part that doesn't work in most people in their teens and early 20s
[2012-02-14 01:33:54 UTC] <ashley> but after that it's like, come on dude
[2012-02-14 01:34:04 UTC] <ashley> but then you've got the addiction shit to deal with

[2012-02-14 17:54:20 UTC] <charlie> "An Ok Mic" is a good name for a shitty musician's memoirs 
[2012-02-14 17:54:31 UTC] <ashley> especially if he was named Mike
[2012-02-14 17:54:42 UTC] <ashley> that would just be so tragic and perfect

[2012-02-14 17:56:16 UTC] <charlie> we have to watch that
[2012-02-14 17:56:20 UTC] <charlie> but it sort of requires you to be super baked
[2012-02-14 17:56:22 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-14 17:56:26 UTC] <ashley> well
[2012-02-14 17:56:30 UTC] <ashley> i'm capable of that
[2012-02-14 17:56:30 UTC] <charlie> not that that would ever happen

[2012-02-14 17:56:34 UTC] <ashley> HA
[2012-02-14 17:56:34 UTC] <charlie> but yeah
[2012-02-14 17:56:37 UTC] <charlie> i was walking to the subway
[2012-02-14 17:56:41 UTC] <charlie> and it's like, sunny tweed weather here
[2012-02-14 17:56:49 UTC] <ashley> man

[2012-02-14 17:56:53 UTC] <charlie> and my lover far away bought me a coffee
[2012-02-14 17:57:07 UTC] <charlie> and it was like welp
[2012-02-14 17:57:09 UTC] <ashley> :)
[2012-02-14 17:57:18 UTC] <ashley> HB
[2012-02-14 17:57:34 UTC] <charlie> it's probably about as good as it gets on earth around now
[2012-02-14 17:57:48 UTC] <charlie> i mean, i can't imagine it getting that much better for humans
[2012-02-14 17:57:59 UTC] <charlie> ha, oh man.
[2012-02-14 17:58:02 UTC] <charlie> this is a longer conversatoin
[2012-02-14 17:58:07 UTC] <ashley> i always get scared to declare highest heights like that
[2012-02-14 17:58:08 UTC] <charlie> but i think i'm really really interested in the cold war now
[2012-02-14 17:58:12 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHA
[2012-02-14 17:58:16 UTC] <ashley> dude yeah
[2012-02-14 17:58:17 UTC] <ashley> that makes sense
[2012-02-14 17:58:17 UTC] <charlie> i was playing that game
[2012-02-14 17:58:18 UTC] <charlie> and just
[2012-02-14 17:58:22 UTC] <charlie> hating it dude
[2012-02-14 17:58:23 UTC] <ashley> that's been one of those weird simmering interests
[2012-02-14 17:58:29 UTC] <charlie> it's so chaotic
[2012-02-14 17:58:45 UTC] <charlie> so you're like, increasing your "influence" in countries all over earth
[2012-02-14 17:58:47 UTC] <ashley> well i think -we- were talking about it the other night, not last night but another time
[2012-02-14 17:58:57 UTC] <ashley> and how it was just so delicate and how shit could have gone INSANE so easily
[2012-02-14 17:59:01 UTC] <charlie> yeah!
[2012-02-14 17:59:05 UTC] <charlie> this game has defcons
[2012-02-14 17:59:10 UTC] <charlie> and they go up whenever you stage a coup
[2012-02-14 17:59:10 UTC] <ashley> and how could people lived then must have felt about that
[2012-02-14 17:59:28 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-14 17:59:28 UTC] <charlie> it's just so nuts, and you play cards to modify the game
[2012-02-14 17:59:33 UTC] <charlie> and they're all events
[2012-02-14 17:59:36 UTC] <charlie> like, real historical events
[2012-02-14 17:59:39 UTC] <ashley> weather.com didn't quite load my san francisco forecast i was trying to load up
[2012-02-14 17:59:40 UTC] <ashley> http://gyazo.com/b6ace2008ad13f006fc1e1ed1bd5e482
[2012-02-14 17:59:44 UTC] <ashley> instead of just showed a picture of it
[2012-02-14 17:59:53 UTC] <ashley> that's intense
[2012-02-14 17:59:57 UTC] <ashley> had you played it before last night?
[2012-02-14 18:00:03 UTC] <charlie> we did like a few turns
[2012-02-14 18:00:05 UTC] <charlie> just to learn it
[2012-02-14 18:00:14 UTC] <charlie> i find it like
[2012-02-14 18:00:16 UTC] <charlie> impossibly complicated
[2012-02-14 18:00:20 UTC] <ashley> lol
[2012-02-14 18:00:26 UTC] <charlie> but it's listed as a game that's not so hard on boardgame sites
[2012-02-14 18:01:43 UTC] <ashley> hmm
[2012-02-14 18:01:53 UTC] <ashley> maybe it's one of those games where you just have to get the rhythm down
[2012-02-14 18:02:00 UTC] <charlie> well i was thinking about it
[2012-02-14 18:02:04 UTC] <ashley> all these frickin math phd games seem just ludicrous
[2012-02-14 18:02:06 UTC] <charlie> and the gameplay suits the simulation
[2012-02-14 18:02:12 UTC] <ashley> til someone just tells you 'look don't worry, here's how it is'
[2012-02-14 18:02:13 UTC] <charlie> there's a LOT of chance
[2012-02-14 18:02:14 UTC] <ashley> hmm
[2012-02-14 18:02:25 UTC] <charlie> and like, nothing's that stable, you can almost always just stage a coup
[2012-02-14 18:02:31 UTC] <charlie> and take over a country anywhere on the board
[2012-02-14 18:02:34 UTC] <ashley> wanna play when i'm out there?
[2012-02-14 18:02:39 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-14 18:02:45 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-14 18:02:45 UTC] <ashley> i mean, playing everything by ear and all
[2012-02-14 18:02:56 UTC] <charlie> maria's gone for the weekend
[2012-02-14 18:03:00 UTC] <ashley> game design is tricky
[2012-02-14 18:03:05 UTC] <charlie> so if we wanna get gabe to play boardgames
[2012-02-14 18:03:07 UTC] <charlie> it'll be real easy
[2012-02-14 18:03:11 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha

[2012-02-14 18:06:39 UTC] <charlie> 2 things about it
[2012-02-14 18:06:43 UTC] <charlie> 1) it's a troy episode
[2012-02-14 18:06:47 UTC] <charlie> 2) it's REALLY GOOD
[2012-02-14 18:06:50 UTC] <charlie> SOMEHOW
[2012-02-14 18:06:53 UTC] <charlie> *troi
[2012-02-14 18:06:57 UTC] <ashley> WTF
[2012-02-14 18:07:06 UTC] <charlie> i know
[2012-02-14 18:07:09 UTC] <ashley> is her sitting just -perfect-?
[2012-02-14 18:07:22 UTC] <charlie> "thanks for your input councelor
[2012-02-14 18:07:33 UTC] <charlie> but please go fuck off and have a sit why don't you, i can see he's lying too"
[2012-02-14 18:07:58 UTC] <ashley> yeah she's so so hilariously useless
[2012-02-14 18:08:08 UTC] <charlie> i wonder why they put her on there
[2012-02-14 18:08:08 UTC] <ashley> doesn't she have like, some kind of psychic powers?
[2012-02-14 18:08:17 UTC] <charlie> that's definitely like
[2012-02-14 18:08:20 UTC] <charlie> a new ship position
[2012-02-14 18:08:23 UTC] <ashley> my guess is it was like, to balance out data?
[2012-02-14 18:08:26 UTC] <charlie> to put the ship's shrink front and center
[2012-02-14 18:08:27 UTC] <ashley> it also feels very 90s
[2012-02-14 18:08:29 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-14 18:08:40 UTC] <charlie> i was thinking about it after watching trekkies
[2012-02-14 18:08:48 UTC] <charlie> so it's been around for what
[2012-02-14 18:08:56 UTC] <charlie> 40+ years now?
[2012-02-14 18:09:29 UTC] <ashley> yep!
[2012-02-14 18:09:31 UTC] <ashley> well wait
[2012-02-14 18:09:34 UTC] <ashley> when did it come out?
[2012-02-14 18:09:34 UTC] <charlie> assuming society doesn't completely collapse, what would stop star trek from still coming out?
[2012-02-14 18:09:36 UTC] <ashley> 67 or something?
[2012-02-14 18:09:38 UTC] <charlie> late 60s
[2012-02-14 18:09:55 UTC] <ashley> star trek will always be with us
[2012-02-14 18:10:01 UTC] <ashley> unless something horrible happens
[2012-02-14 18:10:02 UTC] <charlie> they'll just keep making new ones
[2012-02-14 18:10:11 UTC] <charlie> meh
[2012-02-14 18:10:15 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-14 18:10:21 UTC] <charlie> "our modern mythology"
[2012-02-14 18:10:22 UTC] <ashley> a lack of demand for star trek implies something bad though
[2012-02-14 18:10:29 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-14 18:10:34 UTC] <charlie> here's what i didn't like about the new one
[2012-02-14 18:10:34 UTC] <ashley> like, there NEEDS to be that fringe of weirdos who LOVE STAR TREK
[2012-02-14 18:10:41 UTC] <charlie> wait
[2012-02-14 18:10:43 UTC] <charlie> ashley.
[2012-02-14 18:10:46 UTC] <ashley> a society is only as good as its fringe of weirdos

[2012-02-14 18:14:19 UTC] <charlie> nope
[2012-02-14 18:14:22 UTC] <charlie> oh number18 maybe
[2012-02-14 18:14:25 UTC] <ashley> lady with a dog on a bed photo
[2012-02-14 18:14:30 UTC] <charlie> nope
[2012-02-14 18:14:32 UTC] <charlie> fuck what is it
[2012-02-14 18:14:49 UTC] <charlie> http://nmbr18.tumblr.com/
[2012-02-14 18:14:56 UTC] <ashley> nice
[2012-02-14 18:15:08 UTC] <charlie> she tumbled a photo i took of her zine last night
[2012-02-14 18:15:10 UTC] <ashley> i felt like a megastalker when i reblogged steve's weird video tumblr thing
[2012-02-14 18:15:32 UTC] <charlie> "Whoa, thanks to some more peeps showing appreciation and safe receiving of my zine! There will be more copies this week, if anyone else wants one. Non-linear dystopian drama & cyborg smut. <3"
[2012-02-14 18:15:51 UTC] <charlie> she's pretty bonkers.  i don't even know her that well.
[2012-02-14 18:16:15 UTC] <ashley> a prolific tumblrer as well
[2012-02-14 18:16:20 UTC] <charlie> we've hung out but like, never connected.  it's one of those relationships that still feels like, not uncomfortable, but not comfortable
[2012-02-14 18:16:23 UTC] <ashley> ah yes this is basically what the partie pack looks like though
[2012-02-14 18:16:37 UTC] <charlie> you have anybody like that?
[2012-02-14 18:16:42 UTC] <ashley> oh yeah totally
[2012-02-14 18:16:44 UTC] <ashley> ha
[2012-02-14 18:16:49 UTC] <charlie> like, people you've known for years and totally feel like you could call and chat with for no reason
[2012-02-14 18:16:53 UTC] <charlie> but that when you hang out, it's just a little off
[2012-02-14 18:16:57 UTC] <ashley> it takes me a really really long time to get comfortable with people
[2012-02-14 18:17:27 UTC] <ashley> like all the boston peeps, it was like 1.5-2 years of repeated hanging out before i felt comfortable with them
[2012-02-14 18:17:42 UTC] <ashley> but i think that's more just me
[2012-02-14 18:17:54 UTC] <ashley> there are other people who are just a little too out there for me to figure out the footing
[2012-02-14 18:18:14 UTC] <ashley> like, it'll happen eventually, it just takes time to settle in
[2012-02-14 18:18:52 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-14 18:18:55 UTC] <ashley> oh i see
[2012-02-14 18:19:00 UTC] <ashley> so specific to the in person dynamic?
[2012-02-14 18:19:07 UTC] <charlie> eh not necessarily
[2012-02-14 18:19:15 UTC] <charlie> it's just funny like
[2012-02-14 18:19:22 UTC] <charlie> it's hard to put your finger
[2012-02-14 18:19:28 UTC] <charlie> on what lets you instantly like a person and be comforatbel
[2012-02-14 18:19:31 UTC] <charlie> doesn't happen that often
[2012-02-14 18:19:35 UTC] <ashley> charlie, you're so fucking awesome.
[2012-02-14 18:19:41 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-14 18:19:47 UTC] <charlie> and it's not just like, shared interest, or sense of humor, or physicality or anything
[2012-02-14 18:19:53 UTC] <charlie> l you
[2012-02-14 18:19:56 UTC] <charlie> love you 
[2012-02-14 18:19:58 UTC] <charlie> why would i write l?
[2012-02-14 18:20:02 UTC] <ashley> well in our case i think makeouts were a good incentive
[2012-02-14 18:20:04 UTC] <ashley> hahahahaha
[2012-02-14 18:20:06 UTC] <ashley> KEEP IT SECRET
[2012-02-14 18:20:20 UTC] <ashley> like
[2012-02-14 18:20:22 UTC] <ashley> ehhh
[2012-02-14 18:20:58 UTC] <ashley> ok to lay a few more cards on the table, when we kicked this shit off i remember thinking like, 'ok, i have literally almost nothing to lose here, so i may as well just completely be myself for once and we'll see how that goes'
[2012-02-14 18:21:01 UTC] <ashley> it was like
[2012-02-14 18:21:13 UTC] <ashley> a good moment of being ready to do that personally, and it being a good experimental setup
[2012-02-14 18:21:36 UTC] <ashley> like, great rewards were possible, but if it went haywire, it's not like i was gonna see you every day
[2012-02-14 18:22:01 UTC] <charlie> yeah that makes sense
[2012-02-14 18:22:45 UTC] <ashley> but it was also like, this constant positive feedback loop of you doing and saying and being this person that was like
[2012-02-14 18:22:47 UTC] <ashley> oh come on
[2012-02-14 18:22:51 UTC] <ashley> GIVE ME A BREAK
[2012-02-14 18:22:57 UTC] <ashley> so there
[2012-02-14 18:23:04 UTC] <charlie> ha!
[2012-02-14 18:23:07 UTC] <charlie> FUCK
[2012-02-14 18:23:14 UTC] <ashley> it's pretty early for this shit but there it is anyway
[2012-02-14 18:23:22 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-14 18:23:25 UTC] <ashley> i guess i'm just saying it's on both ends
[2012-02-14 18:23:53 UTC] <charlie> explain!
[2012-02-14 18:23:55 UTC] <charlie> enhance!
[2012-02-14 18:24:01 UTC] <ashley> if you're willing to put your shit out there faster, there's still no guarantee there'll be a connection
[2012-02-14 18:24:18 UTC] <charlie> oh
[2012-02-14 18:24:21 UTC] <charlie> yeah that's very true
[2012-02-14 18:24:30 UTC] <ashley> every human relationship has its own hz frequency
[2012-02-14 18:24:30 UTC] <charlie> i mean, i didn't just like, suddenly open up with you because you'd be going away soon
[2012-02-14 18:24:43 UTC] <ashley> so if you rush your shit in a low speed relationship, it could blow up in your face
[2012-02-14 18:24:50 UTC] <charlie> yeah true
[2012-02-14 18:24:59 UTC] <ashley> but then there's like the boston peeps
[2012-02-14 18:25:06 UTC] <ashley> where i wasn't really comfortable/myself around them for a long, long time
[2012-02-14 18:25:29 UTC] <ashley> little pieces would leak out but i was pretty shy from like, say, 2008-2010
[2012-02-14 18:25:43 UTC] <ashley> and it worked out well 
[2012-02-14 18:25:59 UTC] <ashley> coulda maybe gone a little faster, but it worked for me and didn't eff up the friendship
[2012-02-14 18:26:20 UTC] <ashley> anyway, i'm doing it again
[2012-02-14 18:26:33 UTC] <ashley> where i'm just making my brain fully r/w/x to you
[2012-02-14 18:26:34 UTC] <ashley> blah
[2012-02-14 18:26:41 UTC] <charlie> FUCK
[2012-02-14 18:26:48 UTC] <charlie> you're so fuckin' awesome

[2012-02-15 06:51:08 UTC] <ashley> i was eating a burger
[2012-02-15 06:51:14 UTC] <ashley> and it wasn't even like, a HUGE bite
[2012-02-15 06:51:16 UTC] <ashley> it was medium
[2012-02-15 06:51:31 UTC] <ashley> and, it turns out, the EXACT shape of my larynx throat tube
[2012-02-15 06:51:34 UTC] <ashley> whatever one that is
[2012-02-15 06:51:38 UTC] <ashley> not the esophagus
[2012-02-15 06:51:40 UTC] <charlie> cripes
[2012-02-15 06:51:46 UTC] <ashley> so i like
[2012-02-15 06:51:48 UTC] <ashley> took a bite
[2012-02-15 06:51:55 UTC] <ashley> and for a second iw as like, ok cmon cough it up
[2012-02-15 06:51:59 UTC] <ashley> and then time passed
[2012-02-15 06:52:03 UTC] <ashley> what felt like half a minute
[2012-02-15 06:52:07 UTC] <ashley> but i'm sure was like 5 seconds
[2012-02-15 06:52:15 UTC] <ashley> and it became clear i couldn't breath
[2012-02-15 06:52:21 UTC] <charlie> fuck
[2012-02-15 06:52:30 UTC] <ashley> i was sitting on the sidelines
[2012-02-15 06:52:37 UTC] <ashley> so i got up and walked over to where sean and abby were
[2012-02-15 06:52:44 UTC] <ashley> figuring they were the most likely to know the heimlich
[2012-02-15 06:52:50 UTC] <ashley> abby works at restaurants
[2012-02-15 06:52:57 UTC] <ashley> and sean just seems like he'd know shit like that
[2012-02-15 06:53:06 UTC] <ashley> and i like, start motioning to my throat
[2012-02-15 06:53:19 UTC] <ashley> but can't remember the 'i'm choking' motion taught in health class
[2012-02-15 06:53:20 UTC] <ashley> FINALLY!
[2012-02-15 06:53:22 UTC] <ashley> it comes to me
[2012-02-15 06:53:35 UTC] <ashley> and sean just gives me a wee baby heimlich and it popped right out
[2012-02-15 06:53:45 UTC] <ashley> and abby took me to the bathroom to make sure i was ok
[2012-02-15 06:53:47 UTC] <ashley> it was like
[2012-02-15 06:53:50 UTC] <ashley> oddly really scary
[2012-02-15 06:53:57 UTC] <ashley> like, about 20-30 seconds away from being -really- scary
[2012-02-15 06:54:05 UTC] <charlie> man

[2012-02-15 06:54:14 UTC] <charlie> yeah that's really scary
[2012-02-15 06:54:22 UTC] <ashley> and when you learn that shit in red cross health class, you always kinda think, will i ever need this?
[2012-02-15 06:54:29 UTC] <ashley> i'm just glad it worked like right away
[2012-02-15 06:54:36 UTC] <charlie> remind me to buy sean drinks for the rest of his life

[2012-02-15 08:42:12 UTC] <ashley> http://www.sparkfun.com/products/569

[2012-02-15 18:26:22 UTC] <charlie> it's such a human thing
[2012-02-15 18:26:33 UTC] <ashley> my mom used to ride her friend's horse on their farm when she was growing up

[2012-02-15 18:27:48 UTC] <ashley> they have an inherent rhythm though
[2012-02-15 18:27:52 UTC] <charlie> it's gotta tap into something pretty low down

[2012-02-15 20:13:23 UTC] <charlie> sort of 
[2012-02-15 20:13:35 UTC] <charlie> i guess like the culture of then didn't used to seem so old
[2012-02-15 20:13:40 UTC] <charlie> and it just feels older and older

[2012-02-15 20:14:06 UTC] <charlie> i think some gas station had these 50s music cassette tapes they were giving away one summer
[2012-02-15 20:14:11 UTC] <charlie> and i was like, all about them 
[2012-02-15 20:14:33 UTC] <charlie> so i'd make him go to Getty or whatever so we could eventually get these best of the 50s tapes, and listening to them was like
[2012-02-15 20:14:48 UTC] <charlie> 59 -> 86 or 87
[2012-02-15 20:15:06 UTC] <charlie> you know, it's a while, but it's just the shit my dad listened to 20 years ago or something
[2012-02-15 20:15:08 UTC] <ashley> ahhh
[2012-02-15 20:15:11 UTC] <charlie> it wasn't "another time" then
[2012-02-15 20:15:15 UTC] <charlie> it was just kinda retro
[2012-02-15 20:15:17 UTC] <ashley> thats awesome
[2012-02-15 20:15:28 UTC] <charlie> you know, like some early 90s music now
[2012-02-15 20:15:34 UTC] <ashley> totally
[2012-02-15 20:15:34 UTC] <charlie> "oh wow, that was 20 years ago?"
[2012-02-15 20:15:40 UTC] <charlie> but 50s now is like
[2012-02-15 20:15:42 UTC] <ashley> 20 years ago!
[2012-02-15 20:15:43 UTC] <charlie> from another planet
[2012-02-15 20:15:58 UTC] <ashley> totally

[2012-02-15 20:16:13 UTC] <ashley> like, success made america CRAZY
[2012-02-15 20:16:30 UTC] <charlie> i know!
[2012-02-15 20:16:36 UTC] <charlie> we were just in charge of earth
[2012-02-15 20:16:39 UTC] <ashley> i've been half assing a dispatch to you for like, 2 weeks now
[2012-02-15 20:16:41 UTC] <ashley> basically since i got back
[2012-02-15 20:16:42 UTC] <charlie> and i mean, we sort of earned it, but not really
[2012-02-15 20:16:54 UTC] <ashley> but we keep bringing up all the topics just in conversation
[2012-02-15 20:16:54 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-15 20:16:58 UTC] <charlie> haha yeah
[2012-02-15 20:17:01 UTC] <charlie> i have been noodling one
[2012-02-15 20:17:06 UTC] <ashley> eh, we were lucky and not the Worst
[2012-02-15 20:17:07 UTC] <charlie> mostly in my head
[2012-02-15 20:17:09 UTC] <charlie> yeah 
[2012-02-15 20:17:11 UTC] <charlie> exactly
[2012-02-15 20:17:19 UTC] <charlie> we shouldn't have epic poems about us
[2012-02-15 20:17:23 UTC] <charlie> except maybe our space program
[2012-02-15 20:17:29 UTC] <ashley> lol
[2012-02-15 20:17:30 UTC] <charlie> but we weren't awful
[2012-02-15 20:17:32 UTC] <ashley> it's true man
[2012-02-15 20:17:36 UTC] <charlie> given the amount of power we had
[2012-02-15 20:17:38 UTC] <charlie> we didn't destroy earth
[2012-02-15 20:17:42 UTC] <charlie> so, you know, bonus
[2012-02-15 20:17:46 UTC] <ashley> like, a true moment of hopefulness for humanity
[2012-02-15 20:17:53 UTC] <charlie> man
[2012-02-15 20:17:57 UTC] <charlie> but yeah another thing with jule last night
[2012-02-15 20:17:59 UTC] <ashley> it's all wrapped up in science and progressiveness and not being afraid of differences
[2012-02-15 20:18:01 UTC] <ashley> ah yeah?
[2012-02-15 20:18:02 UTC] <charlie> just how weird the nationalism in america is
[2012-02-15 20:18:09 UTC] <ashley> yeah i'm real happy we didn't destroy earth
[2012-02-15 20:18:12 UTC] <charlie> the pledge of allegiance in schools
[2012-02-15 20:18:12 UTC] <ashley> ah yeah?
[2012-02-15 20:18:14 UTC] <charlie> is SO weird
[2012-02-15 20:18:15 UTC] <ashley> you touched on that a little
[2012-02-15 20:18:18 UTC] <charlie> he said
[2012-02-15 20:18:19 UTC] <ashley> like the dudes who come to see him
[2012-02-15 20:18:23 UTC] <ashley> who are like, welp, it's the best!
[2012-02-15 20:18:25 UTC] <ashley> obvy!
[2012-02-15 20:18:27 UTC] <ashley> TOTES OBVY
[2012-02-15 20:18:28 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-15 20:18:35 UTC] <charlie> "make a list of the countries that make their children salute their flag every morning from birth"
[2012-02-15 20:18:37 UTC] <ashley> in their old man from pennsylvania way
[2012-02-15 20:18:43 UTC] <charlie> "and I bet you won't like the company you're in"
[2012-02-15 20:18:49 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHA
[2012-02-15 20:18:54 UTC] <charlie> like
[2012-02-15 20:18:55 UTC] <ashley> wow
[2012-02-15 20:18:56 UTC] <charlie> man, he just nailed it
[2012-02-15 20:18:57 UTC] <ashley> never thought of that
[2012-02-15 20:18:59 UTC] <charlie> touche right?
[2012-02-15 20:19:05 UTC] <charlie> it's a really shitty thing to make kids do
[2012-02-15 20:19:13 UTC] <charlie> kind of blindly just say america's great and chosen by god to be awesome
[2012-02-15 20:19:21 UTC] <charlie> before you can really understand it
[2012-02-15 20:19:47 UTC] <ashley> hmmm
[2012-02-15 20:19:50 UTC] <ashley> well, it's one of those things
[2012-02-15 20:19:57 UTC] <charlie> i mean, we're not a fascist society, and we have a lot of freedom here
[2012-02-15 20:20:04 UTC] <charlie> but there are these little things
[2012-02-15 20:20:07 UTC] <charlie> that are kinda creepy
[2012-02-15 20:20:32 UTC] <ashley> where it's shitty to make kids do a lot of crazy shit, but they have no choice because of the whole Parenting thing
[2012-02-15 20:20:39 UTC] <ashley> but very few are nationalistically maintained
[2012-02-15 20:20:45 UTC] <charlie> right
[2012-02-15 20:20:48 UTC] <ashley> and cause local news stories when there's some hippie family that refuses
[2012-02-15 20:21:06 UTC] <ashley> that's the sad part of it - when you're a kid it's like, CONFORM OR DIE
[2012-02-15 20:21:21 UTC] <ashley> but on the other hand i can never remember any real message of patriotism being imparted with the pledge of allegiance
[2012-02-15 20:21:28 UTC] <ashley> i just remember it being this arbitrary thing i had to memorize
[2012-02-15 20:21:33 UTC] <ashley> like every other fucking thing is when you're that age
[2012-02-15 20:21:37 UTC] <charlie> that's true
[2012-02-15 20:21:39 UTC] <charlie> that's a good point
[2012-02-15 20:21:42 UTC] <charlie> but 
[2012-02-15 20:21:45 UTC] <ashley> but
[2012-02-15 20:21:47 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-15 20:21:50 UTC] <charlie> we're real smart
[2012-02-15 20:21:50 UTC] <ashley> it shouldn't be mandated
[2012-02-15 20:21:56 UTC] <ashley> by the government
[2012-02-15 20:22:00 UTC] <ashley> to like, do a -thing- every day
[2012-02-15 20:22:14 UTC] <ashley> it's kindof like having a prayer in school every day
[2012-02-15 20:22:16 UTC] <ashley> just creepy
[2012-02-15 20:22:18 UTC] <charlie> a lot of people jsut don't learn to question authority i think
[2012-02-15 20:22:24 UTC] <ashley> oh god did you have to pray in catholic school?
[2012-02-15 20:22:29 UTC] <charlie> ha!
[2012-02-15 20:22:32 UTC] <charlie> every morning dude
[2012-02-15 20:22:35 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHAHHAH
[2012-02-15 20:22:37 UTC] <ashley> ok so
[2012-02-15 20:22:40 UTC] <ashley> what was that like?
[2012-02-15 20:22:44 UTC] <charlie> hmm
[2012-02-15 20:22:45 UTC] <ashley> what did baby charlie do with that time?
[2012-02-15 20:22:48 UTC] <charlie> it was different over time
[2012-02-15 20:22:55 UTC] <charlie> well we just said like, our father's and shit
[2012-02-15 20:23:07 UTC] <charlie> catholicism is like
[2012-02-15 20:23:18 UTC] <charlie> you're not out to learn anything from it
[2012-02-15 20:23:21 UTC] <charlie> that's not its goal
[2012-02-15 20:23:33 UTC] <charlie> it's liebowitz, you knwo?
[2012-02-15 20:23:44 UTC] <charlie> tradition will carry us through
[2012-02-15 20:23:50 UTC] <ashley> ahh yes
[2012-02-15 20:23:52 UTC] <charlie> so you just learn all this shit and say it all the time
[2012-02-15 20:23:57 UTC] <charlie> but i mean, i believed in that god for a long while
[2012-02-15 20:24:01 UTC] <ashley> there wasn't a lot of that in presbyterianism
[2012-02-15 20:24:11 UTC] <ashley> there was like, the lord's prayer, and a prayer we say at thanksgiving
[2012-02-15 20:24:14 UTC] <charlie> it was all i was really presented with
[2012-02-15 20:24:23 UTC] <ashley> but when you pray it was like OK FUCKER BUCKLE IN AND TALK TO GOD
[2012-02-15 20:24:38 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-15 20:24:40 UTC] <ashley> well it's tricky
[2012-02-15 20:24:59 UTC] <ashley> i mean, you were presented that because it's what your parents thought was the best thing for you
[2012-02-15 20:25:05 UTC] <charlie> well
[2012-02-15 20:25:05 UTC] <ashley> and eventually you were like, sorry, nope, not for me
[2012-02-15 20:25:07 UTC] <charlie> they also bought it
[2012-02-15 20:25:11 UTC] <ashley> and some people maybe were like 'ok this is the jam'
[2012-02-15 20:25:13 UTC] <ashley> right
[2012-02-15 20:25:24 UTC] <charlie> yeah i mean
[2012-02-15 20:25:27 UTC] <ashley> well, that kinda goes just along with them believing it was the best for you
[2012-02-15 20:25:39 UTC] <charlie> yeah true
[2012-02-15 20:25:51 UTC] <ashley> do you think the pledge of allegiance is mandated because of some like, weird america breeding program?
[2012-02-15 20:25:51 UTC] <ashley> hm
[2012-02-15 20:25:52 UTC] <charlie> but it's just a big fat system that doesn't believe in self-examination
[2012-02-15 20:25:54 UTC] <ashley> how did that start i wonder
[2012-02-15 20:26:05 UTC] <charlie> which is dangerous 
[2012-02-15 20:26:09 UTC] <ashley> well, i guess i'm just trying to draw it back to that
[2012-02-15 20:26:14 UTC] <charlie> because you can only get out of it if you like, wake up
[2012-02-15 20:26:32 UTC] <charlie> and that's sort of a bummer, i wonder how many people would get sentient
[2012-02-15 20:26:38 UTC] <ashley> and the bottom line is, you end up either believing that religion and/or our government are objectively bad
[2012-02-15 20:26:44 UTC] <charlie> if there was like, an anti-establishment curriculum
[2012-02-15 20:26:48 UTC] <ashley> or you think of it as more of a sliding scale
[2012-02-15 20:27:20 UTC] <ashley> haha i remember in college i had a 'sentient people' society
[2012-02-15 20:27:23 UTC] <ashley> in our art class
[2012-02-15 20:27:31 UTC] <charlie> !

[2012-02-15 20:47:43 UTC] <charlie> at least like 7 times
[2012-02-15 20:47:59 UTC] <charlie> it's one of my favorites to go back and reread, esp if i'm travelling
[2012-02-15 20:48:04 UTC] <ashley> BUT you cannot deny that as a trilogy, and in fact, i think the other two movies moreso than the third, it's PRETTY fucking good, compared to what Might Have Been
[2012-02-15 20:48:07 UTC] <ashley> aww, billie
[2012-02-15 20:48:08 UTC] <ashley> loverman
[2012-02-15 20:48:11 UTC] <charlie> so
[2012-02-15 20:48:12 UTC] <ashley> YAY GOOD MUSIC DAY
[2012-02-15 20:48:18 UTC] <ashley> <3
[2012-02-15 20:48:19 UTC] <charlie> eh, i just like
[2012-02-15 20:48:21 UTC] <ashley> that's fucking great
[2012-02-15 20:48:23 UTC] <charlie> i don't necessarily wanna change that
[2012-02-15 20:48:26 UTC] <ashley> hmm
[2012-02-15 20:48:29 UTC] <ashley> well, i can respect that
[2012-02-15 20:48:30 UTC] <charlie> i don't neccessarily want all these actors
[2012-02-15 20:48:32 UTC] <ashley> let's wait and see
[2012-02-15 20:48:35 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-15 20:48:36 UTC] <charlie> to take over the images of this i have already from reading it
[2012-02-15 20:48:40 UTC] <ashley> good point
[2012-02-15 20:48:41 UTC] <charlie> same reason i'm not going to see gatsby
[2012-02-15 20:48:47 UTC] <ashley> oh yeah fuck that
[2012-02-15 20:48:50 UTC] <charlie> well, actually also 
[2012-02-15 20:48:53 UTC] <charlie> that's just gonna blow ass
[2012-02-15 20:48:55 UTC] <ashley> except that like
[2012-02-15 20:49:00 UTC] <charlie> the hobbit might be great
[2012-02-15 20:49:01 UTC] <ashley> you just can't make a movie of gatsby
[2012-02-15 20:49:06 UTC] <ashley> gatsby won't stick in your head
[2012-02-15 20:49:07 UTC] <charlie> probably will be
[2012-02-15 20:49:12 UTC] <charlie> and i'll probably go see it
[2012-02-15 20:49:15 UTC] <ashley> so you can go see it, or you can go look at a block of cheese for 2 hours
[2012-02-15 20:49:17 UTC] <charlie> but that's like, the decision i try to make
[2012-02-15 20:49:22 UTC] <charlie> when someone adapts something i love
[2012-02-15 20:49:27 UTC] <ashley> it'll be the same effect on your thoughts of gatsby
[2012-02-15 20:49:27 UTC] <charlie> hahahah!
[2012-02-15 20:49:28 UTC] <ashley> hmmm
[2012-02-15 20:49:30 UTC] <ashley> let's wait and see
[2012-02-15 20:49:33 UTC] <ashley> about the hobbit
[2012-02-15 20:49:36 UTC] <ashley> i won't force you
[2012-02-15 20:49:37 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-15 20:49:43 UTC] <ashley> and honestly you make some good points
[2012-02-15 20:49:52 UTC] <charlie> aside from that 
[2012-02-15 20:49:54 UTC] <charlie> the movies were pretty great
[2012-02-15 20:49:58 UTC] <ashley> like if a movie is really -big-, and pretty good, it can replace all these ethereal things in your head
[2012-02-15 20:49:59 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-15 20:50:01 UTC] <ashley> MOVIES!
[2012-02-15 20:50:05 UTC] <ashley> DONE.
[2012-02-15 20:50:05 UTC] <ashley> NEXT TOPIC
[2012-02-15 20:50:24 UTC] <ashley> i wrote a jungian interpretation of the hobbit in college
[2012-02-15 20:50:30 UTC] <ashley> it was like, one of 3 papers i had to write
[2012-02-15 20:50:33 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-15 20:50:34 UTC] <ashley> CS is not really big on "writing"
[2012-02-15 20:50:43 UTC] <charlie> i had to write a fair amount
[2012-02-15 20:50:58 UTC] <charlie> man, i bet that's long gone
[2012-02-15 20:50:59 UTC] <ashley> it would seem more sensible for a filmmaker / artist type education
[2012-02-15 20:51:02 UTC] <charlie> i wrote a paper on blade runner
[2012-02-15 20:51:06 UTC] <ashley> !!
[2012-02-15 20:51:08 UTC] <charlie> oh actually
[2012-02-15 20:51:09 UTC] <ashley> what about

[2012-02-15 20:51:19 UTC] <charlie> when i was at BUA
[2012-02-15 20:51:40 UTC] <charlie> and the prof called me in because he thought i plagiarized the paper
[2012-02-15 20:51:51 UTC] <charlie> but it was actually just pretty good
[2012-02-15 20:51:59 UTC] <ashley> oh wow
[2012-02-15 20:52:02 UTC] <ashley> that's so shitty
[2012-02-15 20:52:04 UTC] <ashley> and awesome

[2012-02-15 20:52:26 UTC] <ashley> J'ACCUSE!
[2012-02-15 20:52:28 UTC] <charlie> he wasn't like really accusatory and awful
[2012-02-15 20:52:42 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-15 20:52:42 UTC] <charlie> he was just like "this is really good, and it's like, a lot better than your other shit"
[2012-02-15 20:52:46 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-15 20:52:47 UTC] <ashley> awww

[2012-02-15 20:53:21 UTC] <ashley> if you have that paper
[2012-02-15 20:53:23 UTC] <charlie> that's a funny thing to say to someone
[2012-02-15 20:53:23 UTC] <ashley> and you feel ok about it
[2012-02-15 20:53:26 UTC] <ashley> i'd like to see it
[2012-02-15 20:53:28 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-15 20:53:36 UTC] <charlie> i bet it's long gone, i wrote it like 10 years ago
[2012-02-15 20:53:45 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-15 20:53:48 UTC] <charlie> but someday when i do my Big Archival Roundup

[2012-02-15 20:54:16 UTC] <ashley> realistically
[2012-02-15 20:54:19 UTC] <charlie> realistically
[2012-02-15 20:54:21 UTC] <ashley> pretend you're resourcing yourself on it
[2012-02-15 20:54:21 UTC] <ashley> ha
[2012-02-15 20:54:22 UTC] <charlie> probably 2 days
[2012-02-15 20:54:37 UTC] <charlie> if i had all the drives in front of me
[2012-02-15 20:54:48 UTC] <charlie> and a couple 2TB dudes like, wiped and at the ready to receive data
[2012-02-15 20:55:02 UTC] <ashley> woof

[2012-02-15 20:55:51 UTC] <ashley> it only takes a minute for your life to change forever
[2012-02-15 20:55:55 UTC] <ashley> was that the quote?
[2012-02-15 20:55:57 UTC] <ashley> christ

[2012-02-15 20:56:56 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-15 20:56:58 UTC] <ashley> npi's future timeline
[2012-02-15 20:57:04 UTC] <charlie> retroactively
[2012-02-15 20:57:06 UTC] <charlie> just drop all this shit on there
[2012-02-15 20:57:12 UTC] <charlie> this was a project i've been thinkign about for a while
[2012-02-15 20:57:34 UTC] <charlie> because we just keep jumping social networks
[2012-02-15 20:57:42 UTC] <charlie> and shit gets left behind
[2012-02-15 20:57:45 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-15 20:57:58 UTC] <ashley> i'm gonna log in to ol' orkut dot com
[2012-02-15 20:58:02 UTC] <charlie> orkut!
[2012-02-15 20:58:05 UTC] <charlie> i never had it
[2012-02-15 20:58:12 UTC] <charlie> but i had friendster
[2012-02-15 20:58:14 UTC] <charlie> and myspace
[2012-02-15 20:58:21 UTC] <charlie> friendster i just remember NOTHING about
[2012-02-15 20:59:06 UTC] <charlie> hmmm
[2012-02-15 20:59:10 UTC] <charlie> friendster looks very different
[2012-02-15 20:59:12 UTC] <charlie> but it still let me log in
[2012-02-15 20:59:12 UTC] <ashley> http://gyazo.com/1f7cf28a340c6c2283f51a7d6a3ccc99
[2012-02-15 20:59:14 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-15 20:59:19 UTC] <ashley> friendster i remember deleting my profile
[2012-02-15 20:59:25 UTC] <ashley> but i got a screenshot before i killed it
[2012-02-15 20:59:30 UTC] <ashley> i never did myspace
[2012-02-15 20:59:31 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-15 20:59:37 UTC] <ashley> that was my first moment of social network snobbery
[2012-02-15 21:00:14 UTC] <ashley> haaa
[2012-02-15 21:00:15 UTC] <ashley> but yeah
[2012-02-15 21:00:21 UTC] <ashley> it's a funny time capsule
[2012-02-15 21:00:27 UTC] <ashley> 'here's who i thought i was in 2005'
[2012-02-15 21:00:29 UTC] <charlie> it begs the question like
[2012-02-15 21:00:32 UTC] <ashley> the public facing me
[2012-02-15 21:00:33 UTC] <charlie> why do i need to save it all
[2012-02-15 21:00:37 UTC] <charlie> and i have no idea, i probably don't
[2012-02-15 21:00:38 UTC] <ashley> oh sure
[2012-02-15 21:00:39 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-15 21:00:40 UTC] <ashley> nope!
[2012-02-15 21:00:42 UTC] <charlie> people didn't used to like
[2012-02-15 21:00:48 UTC] <charlie> keep their entire lives in a reviewable form
[2012-02-15 21:00:50 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-15 21:00:54 UTC] <charlie> eh
[2012-02-15 21:00:54 UTC] <ashley> nope
[2012-02-15 21:00:55 UTC] <charlie> i eman
[2012-02-15 21:00:56 UTC] <charlie> sort of though
[2012-02-15 21:01:00 UTC] <ashley> but we also don't like, make photo albums anymore
[2012-02-15 21:01:02 UTC] <charlie> authors always like
[2012-02-15 21:01:09 UTC] <ashley> my parents have FUCKTONS of photo albums
[2012-02-15 21:01:09 UTC] <charlie> have collections of their correspondence published and stuff
[2012-02-15 21:01:19 UTC] <charlie> because they wrote TONS of letters
[2012-02-15 21:01:20 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-15 21:01:23 UTC] <charlie> and saved them all
[2012-02-15 21:01:27 UTC] <charlie> so maybe it's been going on for a while
[2012-02-15 21:01:33 UTC] <ashley> and now it's like, totally free
[2012-02-15 21:01:38 UTC] <charlie> but now in a weird way it's so easy that we don't do it anymore
[2012-02-15 21:01:39 UTC] <ashley> it's just harder to denote signal:noise
[2012-02-15 21:02:18 UTC] <charlie> man so tomorrow at lunch time for me you'll be going to the airport
[2012-02-15 21:02:28 UTC] <ashley> YEP

[2012-02-15 21:04:55 UTC] <ashley> and 2. nothing really feels out of hand
[2012-02-15 21:05:04 UTC] <ashley> there's a lot more going on than there used to be
[2012-02-15 21:05:09 UTC] <ashley> but i can structure my time however i want
[2012-02-15 21:05:46 UTC] <ashley> the move next week is starting to really creep up

[2012-02-16 01:21:36 UTC] <charlie> i wish i was better at programming!
[2012-02-16 01:21:49 UTC] <ashdroid> Hm, what would tge canary of the codemines be?
[2012-02-16 01:21:52 UTC] <ashdroid> Aww
[2012-02-16 01:22:07 UTC] <charlie> your sanity is the codemine canary
[2012-02-16 01:22:17 UTC] <ashdroid> Hahahaha
[2012-02-16 01:22:26 UTC] <ashdroid> Mine specifically
[2012-02-16 01:22:30 UTC] <charlie> ha, yep
[2012-02-16 01:22:33 UTC] <charlie> if you go crazy
[2012-02-16 01:22:35 UTC] <charlie> i've been coding too long
[2012-02-16 01:22:38 UTC] <ashdroid> Siiigh
[2012-02-16 01:22:49 UTC] <charlie> but it's fine.  i just fixed something
[2012-02-16 01:22:54 UTC] <charlie> a problem with timezones
[2012-02-16 01:22:54 UTC] <ashdroid> Still at the office?
[2012-02-16 01:22:56 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-16 01:23:06 UTC] <charlie> was just trying to pick one last feature to implement before i leave
[2012-02-16 01:23:30 UTC] <charlie> dude, i feel like this code was so clean until about 6 hours ago
[2012-02-16 01:23:43 UTC] <charlie> and i had to like, get a couple things fixed up / implemented
[2012-02-16 01:23:55 UTC] <charlie> meh, it's mostly in my head
[2012-02-16 01:24:10 UTC] <charlie> end of project syndrome, i'm starting to recognize it as a pattern
[2012-02-16 01:29:38 UTC] <ashley> UGH yeah totally
[2012-02-16 01:29:46 UTC] <ashley> that happens at the end of every project
[2012-02-16 01:29:51 UTC] <ashley> i'm convinced it's psychological
[2012-02-16 01:30:06 UTC] <ashley> cause you go from making decisions with the luxury of time and really thinking through everythig
[2012-02-16 01:30:15 UTC] <ashley> to making decisions because they're the fastest to implement
[2012-02-16 01:30:23 UTC] <ashley> so they inevitably feel like worse decisions
[2012-02-16 01:30:28 UTC] <ashley> even if they're actually pretty ok
[2012-02-16 01:31:07 UTC] <charlie> yeah that's a big part of it
[2012-02-16 01:31:20 UTC] <charlie> and you start like, dealing with edge cases
[2012-02-16 01:31:29 UTC] <charlie> and all these crufty if statements show up everywhere
[2012-02-16 01:31:34 UTC] <ashley> yeahh
[2012-02-16 01:31:42 UTC] <ashley> it's totally not worth feeling bad over
[2012-02-16 01:31:49 UTC] <charlie> i knowwww
[2012-02-16 01:31:59 UTC] <charlie> but really dude, i probably should have just done this in codeigniter or something
[2012-02-16 01:32:01 UTC] <charlie> why'd i like
[2012-02-16 01:32:04 UTC] <charlie> build my own ORM?
[2012-02-16 01:32:06 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-16 01:32:27 UTC] <ashley> hahahahaha
[2012-02-16 01:32:31 UTC] <charlie> i feel faced with some sort of axiom about code complexity
[2012-02-16 01:32:34 UTC] <ashley> dude i'm not kidding
[2012-02-16 01:32:45 UTC] <charlie> what about?
[2012-02-16 01:32:49 UTC] <ashley> you are going through, in order, the same thoughts i think when i used to be finishing up a big backend project
[2012-02-16 01:32:55 UTC] <charlie> hah
[2012-02-16 01:33:07 UTC] <charlie> glad it's not just me
[2012-02-16 01:33:14 UTC] <ashley> 1. this code is going from not terrible to awful in the last 1% of the project
[2012-02-16 01:33:15 UTC] <ashley> 2. i should have used a framework!!!!!!!
[2012-02-16 01:33:22 UTC] <ashley> next is.. hmm...
[2012-02-16 01:33:26 UTC] <ashley> dispair
[2012-02-16 01:33:28 UTC] <charlie> fuck
[2012-02-16 01:33:33 UTC] <charlie> i HATE dispair
[2012-02-16 01:33:36 UTC] <ashley> despair?
[2012-02-16 01:33:39 UTC] <ashley> hahah
[2012-02-16 01:33:39 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-16 01:33:41 UTC] <ashley> YEAH
[2012-02-16 01:33:41 UTC] <charlie> i hate 'em both
[2012-02-16 01:33:45 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-16 01:33:48 UTC] <charlie> i was just thinking like
[2012-02-16 01:33:54 UTC] <charlie> i'm gonna walk home and put some fuckin' Nico on
[2012-02-16 01:33:59 UTC] <ashley> OH MY GOD
[2012-02-16 01:34:02 UTC] <ashley> hahahahah
[2012-02-16 01:34:06 UTC] <ashley> just ride out the terrible code blues
[2012-02-16 01:34:09 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-16 01:34:13 UTC] <charlie> and just be like
[2012-02-16 01:34:16 UTC] <charlie> "why does this always happen"
[2012-02-16 01:34:19 UTC] <charlie> and look at the stars
[2012-02-16 01:34:28 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-16 01:34:30 UTC] <charlie> and remember that nothing matters
[2012-02-16 01:34:39 UTC] <ashley> have a nice like, 30 minute scheduled period for suffering and malaise
[2012-02-16 01:34:44 UTC] <charlie> ha!
[2012-02-16 01:34:45 UTC] <ashley> then get back in the habit!
[2012-02-16 01:35:40 UTC] <ashley> aw babe
[2012-02-16 01:35:44 UTC] <ashley> i'm sorry you're having the end of project blues
[2012-02-16 01:35:48 UTC] <ashley> but YOU'RE SO CLOSE
[2012-02-16 01:35:58 UTC] <charlie> thanks darlin
[2012-02-16 01:36:02 UTC] <ashley> programmers always stress out about the code being good
[2012-02-16 01:36:13 UTC] <ashley> but you can't always make the Best Possible Decision
[2012-02-16 01:36:28 UTC] <charlie> i wonder if i'll ever write code i'm like Happy With™
[2012-02-16 01:36:31 UTC] <ashley> usually the pragmatic decision is the Best Decision
[2012-02-16 01:36:34 UTC] <charlie> think it ever happens?
[2012-02-16 01:36:43 UTC] <ashley> and sometimes, the pragmatic decision is the Worst Possible Programmer Decision
[2012-02-16 01:36:47 UTC] <ashley> hmmm
[2012-02-16 01:36:51 UTC] <ashley> no, i don't think so
[2012-02-16 01:36:51 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-16 01:36:52 UTC] <charlie> i think it's rare in like
[2012-02-16 01:36:54 UTC] <charlie> any medium
[2012-02-16 01:36:58 UTC] <ashley> i thik it's possible to come close in personal projects
[2012-02-16 01:37:02 UTC] <charlie> where you'd step back and be like "yes, project complete."
[2012-02-16 01:37:04 UTC] <ashley> but it's the nature of the game
[2012-02-16 01:37:12 UTC] <ashley> underneath it all, programming is a creative practice
[2012-02-16 01:37:13 UTC] <charlie> "wouldn't change a thing"
[2012-02-16 01:37:20 UTC] <charlie> yeah very much so
[2012-02-16 01:37:30 UTC] <ashley> and like any other creative practice, you only get good at it if you stick with it and kinda hate yourself a little along the way
[2012-02-16 01:37:38 UTC] <ashley> along with a healthy dose of being proud of what you've done
[2012-02-16 01:37:40 UTC] <charlie> yeah you know
[2012-02-16 01:37:45 UTC] <ashley> but ONLY after it's been done for like, 3 months
[2012-02-16 01:37:51 UTC] <charlie> i probably have a fairly healthy level of self-code-loathing
[2012-02-16 01:37:55 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-16 01:37:59 UTC] <charlie> nobody should love all their code
[2012-02-16 01:38:02 UTC] <ashley> i'd say you're doin ok
[2012-02-16 01:38:02 UTC] <charlie> or they're lying to themselves
[2012-02-16 01:38:15 UTC] <ashley> the fact that it's only kickin into medium-high gear at the close of the project is a good sign
[2012-02-16 01:38:24 UTC] <ashley> i had coding PTSD my senior year at cmu
[2012-02-16 01:38:29 UTC] <charlie> yeah we paced it out okay
[2012-02-16 01:38:32 UTC] <ashley> and every time i'd sit down to work on my tcp/ip stack
[2012-02-16 01:38:37 UTC] <charlie> man
[2012-02-16 01:38:38 UTC] <ashley> i'd just start crying within 15 minutes
[2012-02-16 01:38:39 UTC] <charlie> dude, do you like
[2012-02-16 01:38:41 UTC] <ashley> it was TERRIBLE!
[2012-02-16 01:38:42 UTC] <ashley> hahahah
[2012-02-16 01:38:42 UTC] <charlie> AWWWWW
[2012-02-16 01:38:46 UTC] <charlie> oh fuck baby
[2012-02-16 01:38:53 UTC] <ashley> aw haha
[2012-02-16 01:38:57 UTC] <ashley> don't worry about past ashley
[2012-02-16 01:38:59 UTC] <ashley> i'm great now!
[2012-02-16 01:39:00 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-16 01:39:03 UTC] <charlie> i know i just did though
[2012-02-16 01:39:03 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-16 01:39:11 UTC] <ashley> i no longer cry while coding!
[2012-02-16 01:39:13 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-16 01:39:15 UTC] <ashley> awww
[2012-02-16 01:39:16 UTC] <ashley> fuck charlie

[2012-02-16 01:39:27 UTC] <charlie> lol
[2012-02-16 01:39:31 UTC] <ashley> oh i definitely cried at barbarian a few times
[2012-02-16 01:39:38 UTC] <ashley> facebook apps mostly
[2012-02-16 01:39:43 UTC] <ashley> 3am in the office
[2012-02-16 01:39:50 UTC] <charlie> dude facebook apps
[2012-02-16 01:39:53 UTC] <ashley> just feeling like, the sheer enormity of impossibility of it all
[2012-02-16 01:39:55 UTC] <charlie> our dark future
[2012-02-16 01:40:06 UTC] <ashley> NOT MY FUTURE
[2012-02-16 01:40:18 UTC] <ashley> i refuse.
[2012-02-16 01:40:21 UTC] <charlie> hah

[2012-02-16 01:40:51 UTC] <ashley> aw
[2012-02-16 01:40:52 UTC] <charlie> i honestly just don't even hate them that much anymore
[2012-02-16 01:40:56 UTC] <charlie> which like
[2012-02-16 01:41:00 UTC] <charlie> makes me EXTREMELY suspicious
[2012-02-16 01:41:04 UTC] <charlie> and nervous for my soul
[2012-02-16 01:41:06 UTC] <ashley> yeah, it seems like you're handling most of it really well
[2012-02-16 01:41:07 UTC] <ashley> lol
[2012-02-16 01:41:12 UTC] <ashley> i'll check it when i'm in
[2012-02-16 01:41:16 UTC] <charlie> ha!

[2012-02-16 01:41:55 UTC] <charlie> everything was cool until a couple days ago
[2012-02-16 01:41:57 UTC] <ashley> is it like, QA starts friday?
[2012-02-16 01:42:00 UTC] <charlie> but it's been RAMPING UP
[2012-02-16 01:42:01 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-16 01:42:06 UTC] <charlie> q&a on monday

[2012-02-16 01:42:12 UTC] <charlie> like, tons of time
[2012-02-16 01:42:14 UTC] <charlie> it's fine
[2012-02-16 01:42:15 UTC] <ashley> so you're not like, launching on friday
[2012-02-16 01:42:24 UTC] <charlie> nope, q&a for like a full week
[2012-02-16 01:42:25 UTC] <ashley> oh lovely, q&a on a holiday
[2012-02-16 01:42:28 UTC] <charlie> adn then it doesn't even launch
[2012-02-16 01:42:29 UTC] <ashley> WHAT WOULD THE PRESIDENTS SAY???
[2012-02-16 01:42:36 UTC] <charlie> until like april or something
[2012-02-16 01:42:42 UTC] <ashley> ohhhh well shit
[2012-02-16 01:42:43 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-16 01:42:45 UTC] <ashley> you're golden dude
[2012-02-16 01:42:49 UTC] <charlie> i know
[2012-02-16 01:42:53 UTC] <charlie> it's not a stressful malaise
[2012-02-16 01:42:57 UTC] <ashley> hahahahaha
[2012-02-16 01:42:58 UTC] <ashley> i see
[2012-02-16 01:42:59 UTC] <charlie> it's just like
[2012-02-16 01:43:00 UTC] <charlie> well
[2012-02-16 01:43:02 UTC] <charlie> here's what it is
[2012-02-16 01:43:10 UTC] <ashley> i am listening
[2012-02-16 01:43:12 UTC] <charlie> i've been sort of really psyched about my code
[2012-02-16 01:43:13 UTC] <charlie> for this
[2012-02-16 01:43:18 UTC] <charlie> i've been feeling really good about it
[2012-02-16 01:43:22 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-16 01:43:23 UTC] <ashley> as you should
[2012-02-16 01:43:31 UTC] <charlie> but yeah, like, it's just crufting up at the end
[2012-02-16 01:43:34 UTC] <charlie> and it's a bummer
[2012-02-16 01:43:35 UTC] <ashley> and, as is rare for any project, let alone up until the last 1%
[2012-02-16 01:43:36 UTC] <charlie> but 
[2012-02-16 01:43:38 UTC] <charlie> it's fine
[2012-02-16 01:43:46 UTC] <charlie> thanks for being the best ever and letting me bitch about it
[2012-02-16 01:43:50 UTC] <ashley> lol
[2012-02-16 01:43:55 UTC] <charlie> and like
[2012-02-16 01:43:55 UTC] <ashley> was that letting you bitch about it just now?
[2012-02-16 01:43:57 UTC] <charlie> understanding
[2012-02-16 01:43:58 UTC] <ashley> i can do that
[2012-02-16 01:44:04 UTC] <ashley> yeah man
[2012-02-16 01:44:09 UTC] <ashley> believe me
[2012-02-16 01:44:11 UTC] <charlie> that's the best part!
[2012-02-16 01:44:13 UTC] <ashley> if there's one thing i understand
[2012-02-16 01:44:14 UTC] <charlie> you get it
[2012-02-16 01:44:17 UTC] <ashley> it's coding self loathing
[2012-02-16 01:44:17 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-16 01:44:25 UTC] <charlie> it feels so personal
[2012-02-16 01:44:27 UTC] <charlie> ah fuck
[2012-02-16 01:44:28 UTC] <ashley> it really is related to creative self loathing in general
[2012-02-16 01:44:33 UTC] <ashley> but it's always more pronounced in coding
[2012-02-16 01:44:37 UTC] <ashley> maybe cause more ego is wrapped up in it
[2012-02-16 01:44:41 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-16 01:44:42 UTC] <charlie> and also because like
[2012-02-16 01:44:45 UTC] <ashley> "THIS IS MY JOB"
[2012-02-16 01:44:49 UTC] <charlie> there's a Right Way in coding i feel
[2012-02-16 01:44:54 UTC] <ashley> "WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ME IF I CAN'T EVEN DO MY JOB?!?!"
[2012-02-16 01:44:54 UTC] <charlie> rather, there's lots of Right Ways
[2012-02-16 01:45:02 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-16 01:45:03 UTC] <charlie> more so than in other creative arts
[2012-02-16 01:45:06 UTC] <ashley> lots of good solutions
[2012-02-16 01:45:16 UTC] <ashley> usually simpler
[2012-02-16 01:45:27 UTC] <charlie> try { } catch {} statements
[2012-02-16 01:45:30 UTC] <charlie> gotta learn those shits
[2012-02-16 01:45:43 UTC] <charlie> and liike, debugging
[2012-02-16 01:45:47 UTC] <charlie> i want to learn how to do that the right way
[2012-02-16 01:45:52 UTC] <charlie> php is such a damn mess
[2012-02-16 01:45:52 UTC] <ashley> in coding, usually a good solution is like, a nice handshake for the problem
[2012-02-16 01:45:57 UTC] <charlie> who KNOWS where the error messages go
[2012-02-16 01:46:00 UTC] <ashley> augh yeah

[2012-02-16 01:46:21 UTC] <charlie> haha!
[2012-02-16 01:46:30 UTC] <ashley> it's just sitting there in its own filth
[2012-02-16 01:46:38 UTC] <ashley> until the end of time
[2012-02-16 01:46:39 UTC] <charlie> 98% of which are just "500 Premature End of Script Headers"
[2012-02-16 01:46:47 UTC] <charlie> the internet's check engine light
[2012-02-16 01:46:50 UTC] <ashley> hahahahaha

[2012-02-16 01:47:51 UTC] <ashley> sometimes you get in this zone where you're a little more bummed / cynical
[2012-02-16 01:48:06 UTC] <ashley> and it makes you even MORE fucking hilarious than you normally are

[2012-02-16 01:52:38 UTC] <ashley> oh and that's the thing, if you had more than 2 days you'd not be sullying it
[2012-02-16 01:52:41 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-16 01:52:47 UTC] <charlie> i just know
[2012-02-16 01:52:51 UTC] <charlie> that like, 2 of these 4 things
[2012-02-16 01:52:55 UTC] <charlie> will release new api's before this launches
[2012-02-16 01:53:03 UTC] <ashley> oh definitely
[2012-02-16 01:53:07 UTC] <ashley> don't even worry about it
[2012-02-16 01:53:13 UTC] <ashley> just prepare yourself mentally for that to happen
[2012-02-16 01:53:14 UTC] <charlie> it is written.
[2012-02-16 01:53:19 UTC] <ashley> you will be pulled back onto it
[2012-02-16 01:53:28 UTC] <ashley> and if that doesn't happen, great!
[2012-02-16 01:53:35 UTC] <ashley> and if it does, that's just the way life is
[2012-02-16 01:53:53 UTC] <ashley> hm, can i ask you another hypothetical question?
[2012-02-16 01:53:56 UTC] <charlie> sure
[2012-02-16 01:53:58 UTC] <charlie> hypothetically
[2012-02-16 01:54:03 UTC] <ashley> so suppose i rendered a video
[2012-02-16 01:54:07 UTC] <ashley> and it came out looking kindof liney
[2012-02-16 01:54:09 UTC] <charlie> i'll try to imagine it
[2012-02-16 01:54:10 UTC] <ashley> like, deinterlaced kindof
[2012-02-16 01:54:14 UTC] <charlie> hmmm
[2012-02-16 01:54:21 UTC] <ashley> any thoughts on that crap?
[2012-02-16 01:54:31 UTC] <charlie> well, just for argument's sake
[2012-02-16 01:54:37 UTC] <ashley> right
[2012-02-16 01:54:37 UTC] <charlie> let's say this video was from, oh i dunno
[2012-02-16 01:54:39 UTC] <charlie> a gopro
[2012-02-16 01:54:39 UTC] <ashley> just for funsies
[2012-02-16 01:54:41 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-16 01:54:44 UTC] <ashley> well that or like
[2012-02-16 01:54:47 UTC] <ashley> a canon 7d
[2012-02-16 01:54:48 UTC] <ashley> you know those?
[2012-02-16 01:54:54 UTC] <charlie> i've heard of them
[2012-02-16 01:55:01 UTC] <ashley> in my hypothetical video
[2012-02-16 01:55:04 UTC] <charlie> well both of those shoot progressive
[2012-02-16 01:55:08 UTC] <ashley> say both sources of footage rae doing that shit
[2012-02-16 01:55:09 UTC] <charlie> so they shouldn't ever get interlacey
[2012-02-16 01:55:11 UTC] <charlie> unless for some reason
[2012-02-16 01:55:15 UTC] <ashley> hmm
[2012-02-16 01:55:16 UTC] <charlie> it was rendered out with interlacing turned on
[2012-02-16 01:55:18 UTC] <charlie> or somethin
[2012-02-16 01:55:18 UTC] <charlie> g
[2012-02-16 01:55:20 UTC] <ashley> hmmmmm
[2012-02-16 01:55:26 UTC] <charlie> and it tried to correct for something that was not an issue
[2012-02-16 01:55:35 UTC] <ashley> "use frame blending"?
[2012-02-16 01:55:51 UTC] <charlie> that's generally for pulling down from like 30fps to 24fps
[2012-02-16 01:56:08 UTC] <charlie> any chance you could like
[2012-02-16 01:56:20 UTC] <charlie> send me a screenshot of an example of the lininess?
[2012-02-16 01:56:25 UTC] <ashley> ooh that could be it
[2012-02-16 01:56:26 UTC] <ashley> one sec
[2012-02-16 01:56:27 UTC] <charlie> and maybe a screenshot of the settings you're using to render?
[2012-02-16 01:56:27 UTC] <charlie> k
[2012-02-16 01:56:34 UTC] <ashley> that would make sense
[2012-02-16 01:57:04 UTC] <ashley> oh i think that might be it
[2012-02-16 01:57:09 UTC] <ashley> when i created the sequence it was dslr
[2012-02-16 01:57:17 UTC] <ashley> (in my imagination!)
[2012-02-16 01:57:59 UTC] <ashley> it's 30fps though
[2012-02-16 01:58:01 UTC] <ashley> the source
[2012-02-16 01:58:02 UTC] <ashley> right?
[2012-02-16 01:58:18 UTC] <charlie> well the tricky part is
[2012-02-16 01:58:22 UTC] <charlie> the 7d is 24p
[2012-02-16 01:58:28 UTC] <charlie> gopro = 30p
[2012-02-16 01:58:41 UTC] <charlie> but, if you make yoru project 30p
[2012-02-16 01:58:43 UTC] <charlie> you should be fine
[2012-02-16 01:58:45 UTC] <ashley> http://gyazo.com/d8827cf46bb95154256be9ad079878c5
[2012-02-16 01:58:53 UTC] <charlie> woah!
[2012-02-16 01:59:08 UTC] <charlie> that's so effed
[2012-02-16 01:59:08 UTC] <charlie> haha
[2012-02-16 01:59:11 UTC] <ashley> my project is totally 23.97 fps
[2012-02-16 01:59:14 UTC] <ashley> YEAH
[2012-02-16 01:59:20 UTC] <charlie> ah
[2012-02-16 01:59:20 UTC] <charlie> yes
[2012-02-16 01:59:25 UTC] <ashley> that is a pronounced moment
[2012-02-16 01:59:26 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-16 01:59:27 UTC] <charlie> so, in your sequence settings
[2012-02-16 01:59:28 UTC] <ashley> so
[2012-02-16 01:59:31 UTC] <ashley> should be 30fps eh?
[2012-02-16 01:59:35 UTC] <charlie> 30p
[2012-02-16 01:59:37 UTC] <ashley> i'm glad we had this nice academic chat
[2012-02-16 01:59:37 UTC] <charlie> i think

[2012-02-16 04:46:07 UTC] <ashley> and he's like, can you redeploy this app?  here's all my usernames and passwords and here's an ssh key, i don't know what that is, and good luck!
[2012-02-16 04:46:53 UTC] <ashley> so now i'm waiting for an answer back re: my email: "ok, neat! imagine there is a 49% chance i won't be able to do this and the app is just down.  how bad is that?  does it effect clients / internal projects?"

[2012-02-16 05:51:04 UTC] <ashley> it's possible i deleted them
[2012-02-16 05:51:07 UTC] <ashley> in a fit of idiocy
[2012-02-16 05:51:07 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> i mean, i am pretty thorough about picture copying
[2012-02-16 05:51:17 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> and wouldn't have let you go without having imported that shit somewhere
[2012-02-16 05:51:22 UTC] <ashley> i really thought you grabbed everything off my machine
[2012-02-16 05:51:24 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> i just have to go through my hard drives
[2012-02-16 05:51:31 UTC] <ashley> le sigh

[2012-02-16 05:52:58 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> the worst case scenario is that we only have crappy awesome jpegs

[2012-02-16 07:44:36 UTC] <ashley> oh hm
[2012-02-16 07:44:43 UTC] <ashley> i just noticed i had the framerate on 29.97
[2012-02-16 07:44:46 UTC] <ashley> instead of 30
[2012-02-16 07:44:48 UTC] <ashley> would
[2012-02-16 07:44:48 UTC] <ashley>  that do it?
[2012-02-16 07:44:57 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> it shouldn't do anything as crazy as you're experiencing
[2012-02-16 07:45:09 UTC] <ashley> well but also - i think i may be the culprit
[2012-02-16 07:45:16 UTC] <ashley> i didn't notice it earlier
[2012-02-16 07:45:20 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> well

[2012-02-16 07:45:29 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> is set in and out points for just a few seconds
[2012-02-16 07:45:30 UTC] <ashley> and then the .mov like, opened in quicktime
[2012-02-16 07:45:37 UTC] <ashley> so it's prrrrrobably that?
[2012-02-16 07:45:40 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> and then you can export and test without waiting a million years
[2012-02-16 07:45:42 UTC] <ashley> yeah
[2012-02-16 07:45:52 UTC] <ashley> no i totes did that, it's always fine for like, 2 seconds

[2012-02-16 07:46:14 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> hypothetically
[2012-02-16 07:48:55 UTC] <ashley> oh also haha welcome to my world of pain on premiere
[2012-02-16 07:48:56 UTC] <ashley> http://gyazo.com/825f2e70c6f60340aac6eaafdcbdbef1
[2012-02-16 07:49:00 UTC] <ashley> this is how my brain works
[2012-02-16 07:49:09 UTC] <ashley> i literally forgot i wasn't using final cut
[2012-02-16 07:49:11 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> oh 
[2012-02-16 07:49:13 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> HAAA
[2012-02-16 07:49:25 UTC] <ashley> or rather, my brain just doesn't distinguish a difference
[2012-02-16 07:49:36 UTC] <ashley> still though
[2012-02-16 07:49:40 UTC] <ashley> if you can suss anything out
[2012-02-16 07:49:40 UTC] <ashley> ha
[2012-02-16 07:49:52 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> k
[2012-02-16 07:50:12 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> ah
[2012-02-16 07:50:25 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> suggestions:
[2012-02-16 07:50:33 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> aspect ratio should be 16:9
[2012-02-16 07:50:33 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-16 07:50:34 UTC] <ashley> YES
[2012-02-16 07:50:36 UTC] <ashley> please
[2012-02-16 07:50:44 UTC] <ashley> you have no idea how little an idea i have of what i am doing
[2012-02-16 07:50:58 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> when you set the framerate to 30
[2012-02-16 07:50:58 UTC] <ashley> or perhaps now you do!
[2012-02-16 07:51:09 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> what are the "field type" options
[2012-02-16 07:51:26 UTC] <ashley> progressive // upper first // lower first
[2012-02-16 07:51:28 UTC] <ashley> defaults to lower first
[2012-02-16 07:51:37 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> k, pick progressive
[2012-02-16 07:51:59 UTC] <ashley> OK!
[2012-02-16 07:52:03 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> and the width and height should be 1920x1080 now right?
[2012-02-16 07:52:17 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> oh man
[2012-02-16 07:52:19 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> asmiov
[2012-02-16 07:52:25 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> says "robot" just like zoidberg!
[2012-02-16 07:52:30 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> or i guess probably the reverse
[2012-02-16 07:53:57 UTC] <ashley> 1920x1080 doesn't work for some reason
[2012-02-16 07:54:02 UTC] <ashley> i have to scale it up from 720x480
[2012-02-16 07:54:05 UTC] <ashley> 1620x1080
[2012-02-16 07:54:07 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> hm
[2012-02-16 07:54:11 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> and the aspect ratio
[2012-02-16 07:54:13 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> is 16:9?
[2012-02-16 07:54:22 UTC] <ashley> yassir

[2012-02-16 07:54:41 UTC] <ashley> that wouldn't be the answer, would it?
[2012-02-16 07:54:48 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> it shouldn't be dv probably
[2012-02-16 07:54:52 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> should be hd 
[2012-02-16 07:54:54 UTC] <bedroom_charlie> what are the options?
[2012-02-16 07:55:00 UTC] <ashley> oh hm

[2012-02-16 20:39:56 UTC] <charlie_> !
[2012-02-16 20:40:00 UTC] <charlie_> love that joker
[2012-02-16 20:40:24 UTC] <charlie_> basically all that matters is that you get on the plane
[2012-02-16 20:40:28 UTC] <ashley> take trash out, unplug everything in the bathroom, charge and email kindle, pack every charger, remember the harddrive sitting on the kitchen table
[2012-02-16 20:40:39 UTC] <charlie_> oh and that stuff
[2012-02-16 20:41:09 UTC] <ashley> right
[2012-02-16 20:41:13 UTC] <ashley> or it all goes right to HECK

[2012-02-16 20:46:44 UTC] <ashley> as long as i get on the gd plane
[2012-02-16 20:47:04 UTC] <charlie_> yep!
[2012-02-16 20:47:13 UTC] <charlie_> man, tbg's 401k matching is sort of a bummer
[2012-02-16 20:47:31 UTC] <charlie_> hey ashley i'm into finances this week!
[2012-02-16 20:47:49 UTC] <charlie_> this means i will drop little nuggets i learn about it for 7-14 days

[2012-02-16 21:03:13 UTC] <ashley> yeah their matching isn't great
[2012-02-16 21:03:17 UTC] <ashley> but it does exist
[2012-02-16 21:03:18 UTC] <ashley> period

[2012-02-17 22:27:22 UTC] <charlie> "Do you hate your job? Are you only still there because you're waiting to vest? I feel your pain, brother. The only thing that kept me from leaving Netscape in 1997 and walking away from a dumptruck full of cash in frustration was this script. I ran this every morning for at least a year: it prints out the following motivational message:"
[2012-02-17 22:27:28 UTC] <ashley> LUCID EMACS
[2012-02-17 22:27:32 UTC] <ashley> MOZILLA
[2012-02-17 22:27:34 UTC] <ashley> HAHAHAHAHA

[2012-02-17 22:27:35 UTC] <ashley> CHRIST
[2012-02-17 22:27:36 UTC] <charlie> that prints out
[2012-02-17 22:27:40 UTC] <charlie> how much you'd lose if you left that day
[2012-02-17 22:27:44 UTC] <charlie> and how long you have till you vest
[2012-02-17 22:27:46 UTC] <ashley> hahahahahhahaa
[2012-02-17 22:27:51 UTC] <charlie> it's a perl script
[2012-02-17 22:27:51 UTC] <ashley> wow
[2012-02-17 22:27:56 UTC] <charlie> http://www.jwz.org/hacks/worth.pl
[2012-02-17 22:28:04 UTC] <charlie> you know, the twitter guy that i met
[2012-02-17 22:28:10 UTC] <charlie> that knew tadpole-rick
[2012-02-17 22:28:10 UTC] <ashley> ha yes

[2012-02-17 22:28:45 UTC] <ashley> fuckin vesting man

[2012-02-17 22:29:17 UTC] <ashley> he was like, "yeah, it's cool to work here, but it's also cool to work for the highest valued company in the world for a year and have stock vested at the end!"
[2012-02-17 22:29:22 UTC] <ashley> THE BOTTOM LINE

[2012-02-21 17:55:22 UTC] <charlie> and then, depending on my exhaustion, it either goes into the trash/curbalert or gets brought along
[2012-02-21 17:55:28 UTC] <ashley> oh that's a good idea

[2012-02-21 18:15:23 UTC] <charlie> "The series is noted by TV critics and historians for the way it reversed the cliché of the standard whodunit mystery. TV Guide referred to the basic plot structure as a "howdhecatchem", although it is now known as an inverted detective story."

[2012-02-21 18:17:14 UTC] <charlie> since i forgot to silence it
[2012-02-21 18:17:22 UTC] <charlie> and i was like 'crap what if it's raspberry pi"
[2012-02-21 18:17:41 UTC] <charlie> i wonder if there's a way to have it only alert me if a message arrives in a certain mailbox or via a certain filter
[2012-02-21 18:17:50 UTC] <charlie> if i can just make it go INSANE if i get an email from raspberrypi.org
[2012-02-21 18:20:34 UTC] <charlie> "In 1968, the play was made into a two-hour television movie that aired on NBC. The writers suggested Lee J. Cobb and Bing Crosby for the role of Columbo, but Cobb was unavailable and Crosby turned it down because he felt it would have taken too much time away from his golf game."
[2012-02-21 18:25:24 UTC] <ashley> hahahah
[2012-02-21 18:25:39 UTC] <ashley> yeah you should release yourself from the tormet that is the raspberry pi
[2012-02-21 18:26:14 UTC] <ashley> when it went off yesterday when we were sexing it like crossed my mind that 1. it might be raspberry pi and 2. i wasn't sure if i'd mind if you'd checked it

[2012-02-21 21:22:30 UTC] <charlie> sometimes an effective strategy

[2012-02-21 21:24:39 UTC] <ashley> some stuff has been removed
[2012-02-21 21:24:49 UTC] <ashley> and some capitalization, but not all, has been corrected
[2012-02-21 21:24:49 UTC] <ashley> ha
[2012-02-21 21:25:22 UTC] <ashley> it's like
[2012-02-21 21:25:26 UTC] <ashley> a certain style of journaling
[2012-02-21 21:25:32 UTC] <ashley> where you just plow through everything that happened
[2012-02-21 21:25:41 UTC] <ashley> rather than just the 2-3 moments in your brain that mattered on a given day
[2012-02-21 21:25:47 UTC] <ashley> when on NPI ALL MOMENTS MATTER
[2012-02-21 21:27:22 UTC] <charlie> "say something, idiot!" "something, idiot!" RESPECT WOMEN!"

[2012-02-21 21:37:38 UTC] <ashley> anytime it looks even close to vaguely organized is like, a mistake
[2012-02-21 21:37:40 UTC] <ashley> a wrinkle in time
[2012-02-21 21:38:07 UTC] <charlie> moving is like finishing an app

[2012-02-22 02:53:26 UTC] <ashley> outside the obvious colombo related advantages
[2012-02-22 02:53:31 UTC] <charlie> yeah
[2012-02-22 02:53:35 UTC] <charlie> i mean, you'd have a SUPER unique car
[2012-02-22 02:54:06 UTC] <charlie> but the disadvantage is you'd have to fix a SUPER unique car
[2012-02-22 02:54:12 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha

[2012-02-22 03:09:11 UTC] <charlie> look at it this way
[2012-02-22 03:09:15 UTC] <charlie> if you end up not wanting it
[2012-02-22 03:09:22 UTC] <charlie> you can EASILY sell it for what you're paying
[2012-02-22 03:09:37 UTC] <charlie> buy it, ship it east, drive it till you're sick of it, and then sell it for $15k

[2012-02-22 03:10:07 UTC] <charlie> i wonder how may star trek stars were in it

[2012-02-22 03:10:51 UTC] <charlie> ably played by Billy Shatner
[2012-02-22 03:11:04 UTC] <ashley> i'm gonna call that peugeot guy tomorrow
[2012-02-22 03:11:10 UTC] <ashley> after a few more hours of forums tonight
[2012-02-22 03:11:11 UTC] <charlie> you really should.
[2012-02-22 03:11:15 UTC] <ashley> they seem pretty reliable though
[2012-02-22 03:11:16 UTC] <charlie> i've been thinking recently
[2012-02-22 03:11:21 UTC] <ashley> wish i was out there sooner than april
[2012-02-22 03:11:23 UTC] <ashley> but gah
[2012-02-22 03:11:24 UTC] <charlie> of getting into the buy cars and ship them east to sell them business
[2012-02-22 03:11:29 UTC] <ashley> oh hm
[2012-02-22 03:11:30 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-22 03:11:31 UTC] <charlie> i really think i could make like
[2012-02-22 03:11:32 UTC] <ashley> yes good point
[2012-02-22 03:11:34 UTC] <charlie> $8k or so a month
[2012-02-22 03:11:41 UTC] <charlie> if i flipped one car a month
[2012-02-22 03:11:53 UTC] <ashley> man
[2012-02-22 03:12:00 UTC] <ashley> that's good money there dude
[2012-02-22 03:12:03 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-22 03:12:09 UTC] <ashley> i mean, not totally reliable, and you've got a little bit of overhead
[2012-02-22 03:12:14 UTC] <ashley> but even if you lower your average a little
[2012-02-22 03:12:14 UTC] <charlie> yeah it's work
[2012-02-22 03:12:17 UTC] <charlie> but it's an honest buck.
[2012-02-22 03:12:18 UTC] <ashley> that's not bad
[2012-02-22 03:12:19 UTC] <ashley> :)
[2012-02-22 03:12:28 UTC] <ashley> or at least taking advantage of localization
[2012-02-22 03:12:29 UTC] <charlie> it's around $1k to ship a car to the east coast.
[2012-02-22 03:12:37 UTC] <ashley> ha let me show you the sad one i found out here
[2012-02-22 03:12:42 UTC] <charlie> do.
[2012-02-22 03:13:21 UTC] <ashley> oh sorry, there were none on the east coats
[2012-02-22 03:13:22 UTC] <ashley> coast
[2012-02-22 03:13:24 UTC] <ashley> http://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/cto/2849843968.html
[2012-02-22 03:13:27 UTC] <ashley> htere was that one
[2012-02-22 03:13:28 UTC] <ashley> ha
[2012-02-22 03:13:34 UTC] <ashley> he's been living in the forest!
[2012-02-22 03:13:40 UTC] <ashley> GONE NATIVE
[2012-02-22 03:14:12 UTC] <charlie> won't load for me for some reason
[2012-02-22 03:14:26 UTC] <ashley> hm
[2012-02-22 03:14:34 UTC] <ashley> bad load balancing!
[2012-02-22 03:14:38 UTC] <ashley> or demons
[2012-02-22 03:14:50 UTC] <charlie> ok
[2012-02-22 03:14:50 UTC] <charlie> http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/cto/2861616324.html
[2012-02-22 03:14:55 UTC] <charlie> http://boston.craigslist.org/bmw/cto/2851197293.html
[2012-02-22 03:15:01 UTC] <ashley> ooh
[2012-02-22 03:15:01 UTC] <charlie> i bet i could get that top car for $2k
[2012-02-22 03:15:11 UTC] <ashley> yeah exactly
[2012-02-22 03:15:18 UTC] <charlie> and if it's in good shape, easy $10k in boston
[2012-02-22 03:15:31 UTC] <charlie> $3k to ship, then i just have to make it worth $7k of my time
[2012-02-22 03:15:50 UTC] <ashley> i mean - i guess that's the trick of it
[2012-02-22 03:15:58 UTC] <ashley> dealing with the buyers is probably the lamest part
[2012-02-22 03:15:58 UTC] <charlie> a new project for the april doldrums
[2012-02-22 03:16:02 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-22 03:16:10 UTC] <charlie> other thing
[2012-02-22 03:16:11 UTC] <ashley> the february doldrums have been nonexistent
[2012-02-22 03:16:15 UTC] <charlie> could go into it with my dad
[2012-02-22 03:16:16 UTC] <ashley> seeing as i forgot it was february
[2012-02-22 03:16:27 UTC] <charlie> and give him something to do that he'd be good at and probably love
[2012-02-22 03:16:31 UTC] <ashley> oooh
[2012-02-22 03:16:33 UTC] <ashley> that's a good idea!
[2012-02-22 03:16:39 UTC] <charlie> like, buy it, if it's in good shape ship it
[2012-02-22 03:16:40 UTC] <clarence> http://img.skitch.com/20100714-d6q52xajfh4cimxr3888yb77ru.jpg
[2012-02-22 03:16:41 UTC] <ashley> yeah if he'd be into it, that'd be fucking great
[2012-02-22 03:16:42 UTC] <charlie> he could do minor shit
[2012-02-22 03:16:48 UTC] <charlie> and then, even if a deal fell through after shipping
[2012-02-22 03:16:54 UTC] <ashley> hahahaha
[2012-02-22 03:16:56 UTC] <charlie> you'd sell it pretty quickly if you had a place to store it
[2012-02-22 03:16:57 UTC] <ashley> MORE SKWERL
[2012-02-22 03:16:57 UTC] <charlie> you know?

[2012-02-22 03:19:17 UTC] <ashley> oh yeah
[2012-02-22 03:19:33 UTC] <ashley> maybe you and your dad could set up some weird tax shelter thing
[2012-02-22 03:19:34 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-22 03:19:41 UTC] <charlie> but i mean, if there's sales tax, that's on the buyer
[2012-02-22 03:19:44 UTC] <ashley> on second thought
[2012-02-22 03:19:45 UTC] <charlie> so it'd just be income

[2012-02-22 17:22:40 UTC] <charlie> what a ghastly visage 
[2012-02-22 17:23:02 UTC] <charlie> so clarence is the digitized ghost of a late 19th century free-form poet
[2012-02-22 17:23:13 UTC] <charlie> actually
[2012-02-22 17:23:16 UTC] <charlie> i feel pretty fine about that
[2012-02-22 17:23:25 UTC] <charlie> i should write him a poetry module
[2012-02-22 17:23:35 UTC] <charlie> i could probably adapt the beatnik script in like, 4 hours
[2012-02-22 17:23:35 UTC] <ashley> man google images just doesn't want to give me a picture of the family circus grandpa on a cloud
[2012-02-22 17:23:39 UTC] <ashley> oh lord

[2012-02-22 17:24:20 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-22 17:24:23 UTC] <ashley> YES
[2012-02-22 17:24:24 UTC] <ashley> ok yes
[2012-02-22 17:24:29 UTC] <ashley> what should i ask that guy?
[2012-02-22 17:24:32 UTC] <ashley> peugeot?
[2012-02-22 17:24:33 UTC] <charlie> ohhh!
[2012-02-22 17:24:38 UTC] <charlie> yes let us deal with that matter
[2012-02-22 17:24:42 UTC] <ashley> my colombo circuits are on the fritz this morning
[2012-02-22 17:24:43 UTC] <charlie> so, full disclosure
[2012-02-22 17:24:48 UTC] <ashley> normally colombo knows just what to say
[2012-02-22 17:24:50 UTC] <charlie> i've never touched a peugeot 
[2012-02-22 17:24:53 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-22 17:24:54 UTC] <ashley> nor i!
[2012-02-22 17:24:56 UTC] <charlie> but 
[2012-02-22 17:24:58 UTC] <charlie> engines are engines
[2012-02-22 17:25:07 UTC] <ashley> and, somewhat troublingly, there's very little on them on the internet
[2012-02-22 17:25:11 UTC] <ashley> since they're FRENCH
[2012-02-22 17:25:12 UTC] <charlie> ok here's what i'd say
[2012-02-22 17:25:12 UTC] <ashley> but yeah
[2012-02-22 17:25:16 UTC] <ashley> straight 4 engine apparently
[2012-02-22 17:25:19 UTC] <charlie> 1.  when was the engine last rebuilt
[2012-02-22 17:25:23 UTC] <charlie> 2.  how many miles are on it since then
[2012-02-22 17:25:45 UTC] <charlie> 3.  where do you take it to get repaired and how often does it go in the shop
[2012-02-22 17:25:59 UTC] <charlie> 4.  what's the mileage like
[2012-02-22 17:26:02 UTC] <ashley> ok
[2012-02-22 17:26:08 UTC] <ashley> you're so awesome
[2012-02-22 17:26:09 UTC] <ashley> thank you
[2012-02-22 17:26:18 UTC] <ashley> i'm a little concerned that it's just a HUGE car
[2012-02-22 17:26:22 UTC] <charlie> oh, it's not
[2012-02-22 17:26:34 UTC] <ashley> like, i don't think i've ever seen one in person
[2012-02-22 17:26:35 UTC] <charlie> if it has a 4 cylinder i bet it's ladybug sized if that
[2012-02-22 17:26:39 UTC] <ashley> haha
[2012-02-22 17:26:51 UTC] <charlie> oh, how many speeds is the transmission
[2012-02-22 17:26:57 UTC] <ashley> it's classified as a 'large family car' in 1940
[2012-02-22 17:27:02 UTC] <ashley> hm, i think 4
[2012-02-22 17:27:06 UTC] <charlie> well, 1940
[2012-02-22 17:27:09 UTC] <charlie> this is a 1960
[2012-02-22 17:27:10 UTC] <ashley> er 1960
[2012-02-22 17:27:13 UTC] <charlie> ah ok
[2012-02-22 17:27:21 UTC] <charlie> back then compact cars were probably like
[2012-02-22 17:27:25 UTC] <charlie> considered profoundly low-class
[2012-02-22 17:27:31 UTC] <ashley> would the speeds in transmission be the same as the speeds in the manual shift?
[2012-02-22 17:27:40 UTC] <charlie> yep!
[2012-02-22 17:27:43 UTC] <ashley> Transmission
[2012-02-22 17:27:43 UTC] <ashley> The 403 came with a manual 4-speed all-synchromesh transmission[3] driving the rear wheels. The gear change lever stuck out from the right side of the steering column.[3]
[2012-02-22 17:27:49 UTC] <ashley> yeah there we go
[2012-02-22 17:27:50 UTC] <charlie> nice!

[2012-02-22 19:29:39 UTC] <ashley> oof.
[2012-02-22 19:29:54 UTC] <ashley> goodbye, sansui d-79R
[2012-02-22 19:30:05 UTC] <ashley> you were a beautiful, but barely ever functional part of my life.
[2012-02-22 19:50:18 UTC] <charlie> aw
[2012-02-22 19:50:29 UTC] <charlie> you did the right thing
[2012-02-22 19:50:35 UTC] <charlie> bringing him to a farm upstate, where he can run free
[2012-02-22 20:04:55 UTC] <ashley> AGKHASDFJALSJDFKLASJDF
[2012-02-22 20:04:57 UTC] <ashley> BOB SOUNDS GREAT
[2012-02-22 20:05:20 UTC] <ashley> he's like an old mechanic dude who just works on old cars and resells them
[2012-02-22 20:05:23 UTC] <ashley> one of those awesome dudes
[2012-02-22 20:05:24 UTC] <charlie> is bob the peugeot guy?
[2012-02-22 20:05:26 UTC] <ashley> yes
[2012-02-22 20:05:27 UTC] <charlie> oh awesome
[2012-02-22 20:05:29 UTC] <ashley> yes he is
[2012-02-22 20:05:34 UTC] <charlie> so what's the story?
[2012-02-22 20:05:45 UTC] <ashley> so, the car comes from arizona originally
[2012-02-22 20:05:50 UTC] <ashley> that's why it's in good shape
[2012-02-22 20:05:51 UTC] <ashley> no moisture
[2012-02-22 20:06:09 UTC] <ashley> then it lived in minnesota for a few years (about 15 years ago), and the engine was rebuilt around 10-12 years ago
[2012-02-22 20:06:22 UTC] <ashley> there are a little over 100k miles on it total, probably around 5k since the rebuild
[2012-02-22 20:06:39 UTC] <ashley> it gets around 33-35 mpg mileage
[2012-02-22 20:06:51 UTC] <charlie> ha!
[2012-02-22 20:07:00 UTC] <ashley> he replaced the front shocks and water pump, those were apparently busted
[2012-02-22 20:07:13 UTC] <ashley> he'd recommend replacing the fuel pump with an electric one to make it more efficient
[2012-02-22 20:07:20 UTC] <ashley> he was just like BLAHHHH HERE'S STUFF ABOUT THIS CAR!!!!
[2012-02-22 20:07:28 UTC] <ashley> anyway
[2012-02-22 20:07:34 UTC] <ashley> it's the real deal
[2012-02-22 20:07:49 UTC] <ashley> oh and the paint he says is a little yucky, lots of little dents and scratches
[2012-02-22 20:07:55 UTC] <ashley> and i guess there's a sun crack in the leather in the seat
[2012-02-22 20:07:56 UTC] <ashley> OH NO
[2012-02-22 20:08:07 UTC] <charlie> hah
[2012-02-22 20:08:10 UTC] <charlie> welp
[2012-02-22 20:08:15 UTC] <charlie> :)
[2012-02-22 20:08:22 UTC] <charlie> want me to look at it?
[2012-02-22 20:08:22 UTC] <ashley> the repair stuff seemed the trickiest
[2012-02-22 20:08:40 UTC] <ashley> man
[2012-02-22 20:08:45 UTC] <ashley> i need to think about it
[2012-02-22 20:08:46 UTC] <charlie> fuelpump might not be a big deal, it was super easy on me
[2012-02-22 20:08:47 UTC] <charlie> *mine
[2012-02-22 20:08:52 UTC] <charlie> i did it myself in about an hour
[2012-02-22 20:08:54 UTC] <ashley> because the thing is
[2012-02-22 20:08:58 UTC] <ashley> this car is great
[2012-02-22 20:09:04 UTC] <ashley> but if i buy a ar
[2012-02-22 20:09:06 UTC] <ashley> car
[2012-02-22 20:09:08 UTC] <ashley> it means i own a car
[2012-02-22 20:09:27 UTC] <ashley> and i have to get insurance, a garage spot, bla bla bla
[2012-02-22 20:09:33 UTC] <ashley> and honestly
[2012-02-22 20:09:44 UTC] <ashley> this was a plan i was thinking about for the ol' 30s
[2012-02-22 20:09:46 UTC] <ashley> somewhere in there
[2012-02-22 20:09:51 UTC] <charlie> yep
[2012-02-22 20:09:54 UTC] <charlie> yeah think about it
[2012-02-22 20:09:58 UTC] <ashley> procure/use a sick car
[2012-02-22 20:10:11 UTC] <charlie> you will find many, many more sick cars
[2012-02-22 20:10:16 UTC] <ashley> i'm gonna look into how expensive insurance and all that is
[2012-02-22 20:10:18 UTC] <ashley> yes true
[2012-02-22 20:10:19 UTC] <charlie> maybe not this particular model, as it is super super rare
[2012-02-22 20:10:21 UTC] <ashley> yeahhhhh
[2012-02-22 20:10:23 UTC] <ashley> that's the thing
[2012-02-22 20:10:23 UTC] <ashley> hahhah
[2012-02-22 20:10:25 UTC] <ashley> DAMMIT
[2012-02-22 20:10:26 UTC] <charlie> but no shortage of awesome cars
[2012-02-22 20:10:26 UTC] <charlie> i know
[2012-02-22 20:10:37 UTC] <ashley> but maybe it'd be good to not have an extremely rare car
[2012-02-22 20:10:43 UTC] <charlie> depending on your driving history, compulsory insurance in cambridge is prolly like $1k a year
[2012-02-22 20:10:55 UTC] <ashley> maybe just a nice looking one that's not the weirdest to work on
[2012-02-22 20:12:20 UTC] <ashley> driving history is like, a real bad ticket in 2002
[2012-02-22 20:12:23 UTC] <ashley> heh
[2012-02-22 20:12:28 UTC] <ashley> <3
[2012-02-22 20:12:32 UTC] <ashley> dude
[2012-02-22 20:12:42 UTC] <ashley> ok, i will let you get back to the heads down party
[2012-02-22 20:12:44 UTC] <charlie> ha
[2012-02-22 20:12:51 UTC] <charlie> i'm about to get some lunch
[2012-02-22 20:13:03 UTC] <ashley> i suppose it is that time
[2012-02-22 20:13:10 UTC] <ashley> what kind of lunch will it be today?
[2012-02-22 20:13:11 UTC] <charlie> and by that i mean, i will go find a bakery and buy bread to enclose the porkloin slices i brought into work
[2012-02-22 20:13:20 UTC] <ashley> YES

[2012-02-22 21:12:46 UTC] <charlie> feel awesome?
[2012-02-22 21:12:51 UTC] <ashley> i fucking love it dude
[2012-02-22 21:13:35 UTC] <ashley> In Buddhism, the primary purpose of life is to end suffering. The Buddha taught that humans suffer because we continually strive after things that do not give lasting happiness. We desperately try to hold on to things - friends, health, material things - that do not last, and this causes sorrow.
[2012-02-22 21:13:35 UTC] <ashley> The Buddha did not deny that there are things in life that give joy, but pointed out that none of them last and our attachment to them only causes more suffering. His teachings were focused entirely on this problem and its solution.
[2012-02-22 21:13:36 UTC] <ashley> This is done by recognizing the impermanence of all things and freeing oneself from attachment to these things. This will lessen suffering and eventually end the cycle of rebirth. These teachings are expressed most concisely in the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, which together form the foundation of belief for all branches of Buddhism.

[2012-02-22 21:30:11 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-22 21:30:17 UTC] <ashley> i was just thinking about like

[2012-02-22 21:31:03 UTC] <charlie> insurance is just like, a huge joke
[2012-02-22 21:31:06 UTC] <ashley> it just seems like, why are we paying them?

[2012-02-22 21:31:11 UTC] <ashley> hahaha
[2012-02-22 21:31:14 UTC] <charlie> basically
[2012-02-22 21:31:23 UTC] <charlie> you're paying them in case you get into a dreadful accident that like
[2012-02-22 21:31:30 UTC] <charlie> utterly destroyed a $50k mercedes
[2012-02-22 21:31:32 UTC] <ashley> ahhhhh

[2012-02-22 21:31:44 UTC] <ashley> what's left of my pitiful respirator-given life
[2012-02-22 21:31:44 UTC] <charlie> it's bad
[2012-02-22 21:31:50 UTC] <charlie> because it's that + medical
[2012-02-22 21:31:52 UTC] <charlie> yeah exactly
[2012-02-22 21:31:54 UTC] <ashley> won't be spent thinking about how i'll be passing on a huge debt to my loved ones
[2012-02-22 21:31:59 UTC] <charlie> you CAN claim like, fender benders

[2012-02-22 22:46:04 UTC] <ashley> the idea is to not put everything in stupid moving boxes

[2012-02-22 22:46:20 UTC] <ashley> so that i can have at least a theory of staying organized when i'm in NuPlace
[2012-02-22 22:46:30 UTC] <charlie> right
[2012-02-22 22:46:36 UTC] <ashley> but that means there's an up front investment of organizing
[2012-02-22 22:46:37 UTC] <ashley> ha
[2012-02-22 22:46:43 UTC] <charlie> hmmm

[2012-02-23 16:31:50 UTC] <ashley> Falk's right eye was surgically removed when he was three because of a retinoblastoma; he wore a glass eye for most of his life.[9] Despite this, Falk participated in team sports, mainly baseball and basketball, as a boy. In a 1997 interview in Cigar Aficionado magazine with Arthur Marx, Falk said, "I remember once in high school the umpire called me out at third base when I was sure I was safe. I got so mad I took out my glass eye, handed it to him and said, 
[2012-02-23 16:31:51 UTC] <ashley> 'Try this.' I got such a laugh you wouldn't believe."[10]

[2012-02-23 18:29:38 UTC] <charlie> and then tail log files in the windows
[2012-02-23 18:29:56 UTC] <charlie> instead of like, alt tabbing around to find which fuckin' console i had the log tail in
[2012-02-23 18:30:02 UTC] <ashley> haha

[2012-02-23 18:31:50 UTC] <charlie> and i wanted it to be the same wherever i went
[2012-02-23 18:31:59 UTC] <charlie> so i could dive into emacs like, ssh'd into production if i needed to
[2012-02-23 18:32:05 UTC] <charlie> and be exactly as fast
[2012-02-23 18:32:07 UTC] <ashley> yeah

[2012-02-24 06:55:51 UTC] <ashley> i was thinking about how all my favorite stuff near my current place is now gonna be a 10 minute walk
[2012-02-24 06:56:19 UTC] <charlie> not so bad
[2012-02-24 06:56:20 UTC] <ashley> and somehow get kindof like, hyperopic about thinking about that general concept
[2012-02-24 06:56:34 UTC] <ashley> how much time you spend in life just wishing things took a little less time, etc
[2012-02-24 06:56:53 UTC] <charlie> ah
[2012-02-24 06:56:59 UTC] <ashley> and then i had this nice moment where things shifted and it was like, or, you could just say 'this will take 10-15 minutes' and enjoy being alive and walking and all that
[2012-02-24 06:57:19 UTC] <ashley> i think it was cause i meditated earlier
[2012-02-24 06:57:28 UTC] <ashley> but i tend to give meditation all credit for anything good ever
