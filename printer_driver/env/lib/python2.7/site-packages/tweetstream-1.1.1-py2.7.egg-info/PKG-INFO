        tweetstream - Simple twitter streaming API
        ##########################################
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        tweetstream provides two classes, SampleStream and FollowStream, that can be
        used to get tweets from Twitter's streaming API. An instance of one of the
        classes can be used as an iterator. In addition to fetching tweets, the 
        object keeps track of the number of tweets collected and the rate at which
        tweets are received.
        
        SampleStream delivers a sample of all tweets. FilterStream delivers
        tweets that match one or more criteria. Note that it's not possible
        to get all tweets without access to the "firehose" stream, which
        is not currently avaliable to the public.
        
        Twitter's documentation about the streaming API can be found here:
        http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api_methods .
        
        **Note** that the API is blocking. If for some reason data is not immediatly
        available, calls will block until enough data is available to yield a tweet.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Printing incoming tweets:
        
        >>> stream = tweetstream.SampleStream("username", "password")
        >>> for tweet in stream:
        ...     print tweet
        
        
        The stream object can also be used as a context, as in this example that
        prints the author for each tweet as well as the tweet count and rate:
        
        >>> with tweetstream.SampleStream("username", "password") as stream
        ...     for tweet in stream:
        ...         print "Got tweet from %-16s\t( tweet %d, rate %.1f tweets/sec)" % (
        ...                 tweet["user"]["screen_name"], stream.count, stream.rate )
        
        
        Stream objects can raise ConnectionError or AuthenticationError exceptions:
        
        >>> try:
        ...     with tweetstream.TweetStream("username", "password") as stream
        ...         for tweet in stream:
        ...             print "Got tweet from %-16s\t( tweet %d, rate %.1f tweets/sec)" % (
        ...                     tweet["user"]["screen_name"], stream.count, stream.rate )
        ... except tweetstream.ConnectionError, e:
        ...     print "Disconnected from twitter. Reason:", e.reason
        
        To get tweets that match specific criteria, use the FilterStream. FilterStreams
        take three keyword arguments: "locations", "follow" and "track".
        
        Locations are a list of bounding boxes in which geotagged tweets should originate.
        The argument should be an iterable of longitude/latitude pairs.
        
        Track specifies keywords to track. The argument should be an iterable of
        strings.
        
        Follow returns statuses that reference given users. Argument should be an iterable
        of twitter user IDs. The IDs are userid ints, not the screen names. 
        
        >>> words = ["opera", "firefox", "safari"]
        >>> people = [123,124,125]
        >>> locations = ["-122.75,36.8", "-121.75,37.8"]
        >>> with tweetstream.FilterStream("username", "password", track=words,
        ...                               follow=people, locations=locations) as stream
        ...     for tweet in stream:
        ...         print "Got interesting tweet:", tweet
        
        
        Deprecated classes
        ------------------
        
        tweetstream used to contain the classes TweetStream, FollowStream, TrackStream
        LocationStream and ReconnectingTweetStream. These were deprecated when twitter
        changed its API end points. The same functionality is now available in
        SampleStream and FilterStream. The deprecated methods will emit a warning when
        used, but will remain functional for a while longer.
